15
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:27,280
‫‫Let's go to it. Imagine a world where speech recognition tools‬‬

16
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:34,960
‫‫are going to support all languages. We don't have a shortage of speech recognition tools now.‬‬

‫‫From Google's own keyboard, that little icon‬‬

20
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:03,240
‫‫fundamentally and from the beginning based on speech. But all of these have a problem. That is‬‬

21
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,840
‫‫that the main focus of all these speech-to-text engines is‬‬

22
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:15,879
‫‫on major languages, on languages with many speakers, like English, Chinese, Spanish, and‬‬

23
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:23,440
‫‫smaller languages, languages with fewer speakers, like Persian now,‬‬

24
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:30,680
‫‫like languages and dialects that have fewer speakers, are neglected in them and‬‬

25
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,280
‫‫the tools don't work well with these languages in that way. They work like English.‬‬

26
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,000
‫‫If you have probably used the same speech-to-text service, text and‬‬

27

‫‫Google speech, it often makes mistakes, it doesn't understand what we are saying, and it writes something else.‬‬

‫‫Common Voice, or Mozilla Common Voice, is going to‬‬

29
00:02:53,239 --> 00:03:00,680
‫‫solve this problem and a series of other problems. It is going to solve the problem of this focus and it is going to‬‬

30
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:09,799
‫‫make Common Voice ensure that no one feels unheard because they are speaking a‬‬

31
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:15,000
‫‫language that is not among those main languages that big companies are focusing on‬‬

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,280
‫‫and investing in.‬‬

33
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:26,560
‫‫Behind the founder of this project, the founder of Common Voice, is the Mozilla Foundation. Now I don't know, kids,‬‬

34
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,799
‫‫probably all of you here know the Mozilla Foundation. If you don't know the Mozilla Foundation itself,‬‬

35
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:39,400
‫‫you probably know its browser, Firefox. The Mozilla Foundation, if I'm not mistaken,‬‬

36
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,720
‫‫started its work in 2003, and the goal of the Mozilla Foundation from the beginning was to make the internet‬‬

37
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,720
‫‫more decentralized, to make it more democratic as much as possible, and to increase collective participation in‬‬

38
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,519
‫‫the internet and in other related projects.‬‬

39
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:04,959
‫‫One of the projects that, as I said, it has started in order to achieve this goal is Common Voice.‬‬

40
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,959
‫‫Common Voice wants to come and fill this gap, this gap that exists for‬‬

41
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:20,639
‫‫smaller languages and increase our accessibility, and a good thing about Common Voice, a strong point it has, is that it‬‬

42
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:27,720
‫‫started from the beginning with collective participation and is going to collect and validate data through collective participation‬‬

43
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,919
‫‫and make it available for free and open source to programmers and developers.‬‬

44
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,639
‫‫So they can build better tools for us. Let's take a look at the project history. This project started in‬‬

45
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:43,919
‫‫2017. Common Voice started working in 2017 and only started with English.‬‬

46
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,680
‫‫In the first year, less than, I think, 9 months, around 500 hours of audio was recorded, segments of audio‬‬

47
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:55,080
‫‫were recorded and validated. Very soon, in 2019, the number of languages that‬‬

48
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,800
‫‫were being worked on in this project reached 18, and we had 1400 hours of recorded audio.‬‬

49
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:08,440
‫‫In 2020, the total hours of recorded audio reached 7200‬‬

50
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:14,520
‫‫hours in 54 languages. We know that we have 700 living languages in the world now, but‬‬

51
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:23,440
‫‫ساعت رسید توی ۵۴ تا زبان. می‌دونیم که ما
الان ۷۰۰ تا زبان زنده داریم تو دنیا، اما‬‬

52
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:31,199
‫The focus of text-to-speech or speech-to-text engines is on less than 10% of them, on those three‬

53
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,160
‫besides those four major languages I mentioned: English, Spanish and...‬

54
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:45,000
‫Chinese. But for those 54 languages they started with, 700 hours of audio samples have been collected. A large and‬

55
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,360
‫significant number. In 2022, the number of languages reached more than 100. Right now, this‬

56
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:57,479
‫number of languages is increasing. In 2024, the total hours of recorded data was 3100 hours‬

57
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:05,680
‫in 129 languages, of which 2000 hours are verified, and in 2025, the 21st dataset of‬

58
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,520
‫Common Voice has been released, which everyone can go and download for free and use.‬

59
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:20,440
‫But why is this important? Why is collecting this data important? Why is collecting these audio snippets‬

60
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,400
‫important? That also goes back to this future‬

61
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,400
‫of user interfaces. We have user interfaces that are moving towards‬

62
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,440
‫this direction to reduce our interaction with our operating systems, with our devices, via the keyboard,‬

63
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:42,479
‫via touch. To minimize it as much as possible and focus on‬

64
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:50,039
‫voice. This trend is so important that many large companies have their own voice assistants.‬

65
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:55,080
‫Apple had Siri, Samsung had Bixby,‬

66
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,840
‫Google, I don't remember Google's name, but yes, Google‬

67
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:07,680
‫Assistant. Microsoft also had Cortana. Even larger companies that had supplementary resources Alexa‬

68
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,039
‫on Windows... Yes, even larger companies that had more financial resources took a step‬

69
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:19,560
‫further. Even introduced dedicated hardware for communication via voice with those devices, with‬

70
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:27,120
‫that software. Like Alexa Home or Google... it had one, I don't remember its name.‬

71
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,759
‫And as you can see, the statistics... I got these statistics from Statista. People are moving‬

72
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:39,120
‫towards more use, more daily use of voice user interfaces. In the car‬

73
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,800
‫they use it more, where their access to typing and now touching their phone is harder. More‬

74
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,520
‫after that, home, and then now public places.‬

75
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,599
‫If we want to give an overall statistic... Oh, I forgot to say this:‬

76
00:07:54,599 --> 00:08:01,199
‫I mentioned the future is moving towards our interaction with our devices being through‬

77
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,720
‫our voice. Here it's important who controls...‬

78
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:12,360
‫this user interface and this data? Who owns these speech recognition engines?‬

79
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,960
‫Right now, there is a lot of discussion about the significant concentration, both on data and on...‬

80
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,120
‫tools, in large companies that have many resources. These abundant resources can be...‬

81
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,039
‫their financial resources that they can spend and buy datasets and different models...‬

82
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:34,360
‫train, and it can also be on the data they have. Google has enormous access to...‬

83
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,000
‫video, to YouTube which has subtitles. For all of them, it can much easier and more powerfully build a model...‬

84
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,680
‫that it wants to build, train, teach. That's why, for example, we see that the strongest model...‬

85
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,560
‫now... speech-to-text for the Persian language is that...‬

86
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,800
‫same Google Assistant.‬

87
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:02,959
‫But Common Voice has come to break this monopoly and change this situation, which is a situation...‬

88
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:10,279
‫concentrated, into a decentralized situation. By focusing on collective participation, on crowdsourcing.‬

89
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:13,959
‫So far, I said that over 100 languages in this project, in Common Voice, are...‬

90
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:21,120
‫working and more than 18,000 hours of audio have been collected, and its participants are throughout the...‬

91
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,399
‫world, 450,000 people. More than 2000 developers are now working on its technical side...‬

92
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:33,200
‫working, which I don't specialize in, the technical guys should talk about that. These statistics were from 2022, statistics...‬

93
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,920
‫newer than this I couldn't find. The statistics are definitely more than this. The Persian language too, thank God...‬

94
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,600
‫thanks to the kids who, as I said, have been working long before me and better than me, has been added to...‬

95
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:49,320
‫this project, to Common Voice. These statistics are the latest statistics on the status of the Persian language on...‬

96
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:59,000
‫Common Voice. The total recorded hours, hours of audio recorded and donated to the project is 434 hours...‬

97
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:08,200
‫donated by 400 people, 86 verified, and the total number of sentences is around 52,000, which...‬

98
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:14,360
‫This statistic is really low. To train, to teach a model...‬

99
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:20,760
‫is good. For speech recognition, we need much more and much more diverse data. For...‬

100
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:26,440
‫this is why we need more people to come to the project and donate their voice, or if...‬

donated voice clips. In addition...‬

103
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:43,079
‫we need more participation.
We also need more diversity. This diversity...‬

104
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:47,040
‫in terms of both gender and...‬

105
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:56,079
‫dialect. I don't think I brought the statistics, but a large portion
of these 434 hours collected‬

106
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:03,040
‫is male voices. We need women to also
come and participate in this project. For after...‬

107
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,240
‫This helps us make the engine we're
building, based on this data, the voice of...‬

108
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:13,279
‫women better. Let's go to the next one. This is the status of the Persian language.‬

109
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:21,480
‫It's Persian. Here, the quality is low in the percentage
of the total donated voice in terms of‬

110
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,519
‫gender, well, I can't read this and tell you...‬

111
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:34,079
‫tell you. That red part is the women in the... language.‬

112
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,800
‫In Persian, it seems that even compared to other
projects, the least participation‬

113
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,040
‫was by women in the Persian language.‬

114
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:54,600
‫If you have questions, ask, so I can move on to
participation. Please add that one thing is three‬

115
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:01,079
‫top ASR models. For those who don't know,
automatic‬

116
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:07,920
‫speech recognition. Three of its top models, one is Whisper.
Whisper Large is by OpenAI, which is also open source,‬

117
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:16,519
‫by the way, and the second model, incidentally, has been fine-tuned
based on this very Common Voice. Its main model is DeepSpeech, yes.‬

118
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:24,760
‫Its main model is Deep Deep DeepSpeech by Mozilla,
but I saw one of the guys on Hugging Face who fine-tuned‬

119
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:31,399
‫Meta's Wav2vec model using this same
Common Voice on Persian, and then‬

120
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:38,040
‫it ranks second after Whisper, its performance is very good. This
is about the models. Now, I myself am working with a‬

‫No, what was that factory in Aryan city? I'm in
Bandar Abbas, not Shiraz. Shiraz kids, help.‬

124
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,760
‫Yeah, we have a Science and Technology Park, we are collaborating.
I am contributing to train‬

125
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:04,680
‫an ASR model, and then we want to go for
TTS. Currently, we are collecting data from‬

126
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,040
‫Persian podcasts. After that, we want to
use Whisper to label the podcasts‬

127
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,480
‫and train a model with it. Very good.‬

128
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:19,519
‫Thank you, but the main part and my goal was to invite you...‬

129
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,680
‫to participate in this project. Participation in the project is very easy, it doesn't even require registration.‬

130
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,639
‫You just need to go to this...‬

131
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:36,440
‫address .milla and select the Persian language. The direct link is at the end of the slides.‬

132
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,720
‫You can scan, select the Persian language or donate your voice, a sentence...‬

133
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:47,320
‫that it brings up, read it. Give access. You can be comfortable with a mobile phone. Working with other devices is also...‬

134
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:54,040
‫easy with it. Donate your voice to the project, or if you can't or aren't interested...‬

135
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,639
‫in participating by donating voice, approve or reject the recorded voices.‬

136
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:04,440
‫You just need to match the voice and the sentence shown here, and approve or...‬

137
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:11,079
‫reject it. This is also easy work. A series of links are provided.‬

138
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:17,600
‫is available. This is also a project need that I remembered at the end and couldn't include in the slides...‬

139
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,920
‫include. The Common Voice project also needs text snippets. Text snippets to be added to...‬

140
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,759
‫the project so that those who donate their voice can read them. There are some conditions...‬

141
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:36,480
‫on how to add these and what criteria they should meet for the sentence to be able to...‬

‫Look how happy someone got talking more about Mr.... Just a few...‬

151
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,399
‫things I wanted to say. One is this, about its application. In my opinion, if...‬

152
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,720
‫‫If you could give a few examples, samples of its use. I'll give one sample...‬‬

‫‫People who are blind, in order to be able
to work with computers, they need something...‬‬

154
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,000

155
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,160
‫‫This screen reader, for example, reads the text
that is on the screen for them.‬‬

161
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:31,680
‫‫It's not free, yeah, and the sound quality isn't very good either. So besides speech recognition, that part...‬‬

162
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:38,160
‫‫of speech synthesis is also very important. Let me give another application. My grandmother never learned...‬‬

‫‫and again, I invite you again, if you come and contribute to the project, it will be very good...‬‬

177
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:02,280
‫‫It will be. Someone had a question. I wanted to know if this project also does something about the diversity...‬‬

issue is that the number of our words and‬‬

205
