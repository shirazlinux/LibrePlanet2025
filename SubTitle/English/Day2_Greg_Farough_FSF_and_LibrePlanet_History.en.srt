1
00:00:07,802 --> 00:00:14,560
[Music] so hi everybody I'm Greg Ferrell I'm the 
campaigns manager of the free software foundation

2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,400
Um thanks for the opportunity for uh letting me 
introduce the free software foundation introduce

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,760
software itself If you're not uh too familiar 
with free software of course I am sitting here

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,920
in the United States This is not live Um but I 
am recording it It is May 7th I understand it

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:39,280
will be broadcast uh May 9th Um so thanks again 
for the opportunity Uh basically in this talk I'm

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,720
just going to give a general overview of the free 
software foundation the work of the free software

7
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:52,640
foundation and touching on uh the kind of broader 
free software community in general how people can

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,840
get involved in the free software community 
and advocate for free software effectively

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:05,920
um like we do on the FSF campaigns team Um that's 
going to start with a kind of general overview of

10
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,320
uh what free software is So as an FSF speaker 
I'm not literally obligated to go through the

11
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,560
free software definition but I kind of include it 
in every talk Um just because as I'm sure all the

12
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,440
free software supporters in the room right now 
know uh it's it's a topic that's like not always

13
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,640
uh immediately understood by people You know they 
may have heard the term quote unquote open source

14
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,960
or quote unquote Linux something like that Um 
but in the FSF campaign team's language we're

15
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,920
always prioritizing freedom uh and the ethical 
uh imperative that software be free So I will

16
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,600
be going through a little bit of that and then 
a general overview of what I do all day as the

17
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:57,120
campaigns manager of the FSF and uh yeah just how 
you can improve your free software advocacy get

18
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:05,440
more involved in free software yourself so that 
we can further the movement Uh so here we go Um

19
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,200
so you may have heard the free soft of the free 
software foundation you may have heard of canoe

20
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,160
but you may not know exactly what we do Um and 
if you go to fsf.org you will see in big bold

21
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,160
text that the free software foundation is 
a nonprofit with the worldwide mission to

22
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,960
promote degrees of freedom That is uh one way of 
putting it The you know more succinct and less

23
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:32,640
um you know standard nonprofit language way of 
putting it might be the FSF believes that every

24
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,800
single person on every single computer everywhere 
should be using free software all the time

25
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,920
They should never be in a situation where they are 
forced to use non-free software commonly called

26
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,000
proprietary software because that is an insult 
to their freedom Uh it is uh an unfair power

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,600
dynamic and it gives the developer uh a power 
over the user that they shouldn't have And of

28
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:02,720
course this is more um evident in you know large 
tech corporations like Apple or Microsoft but it's

29
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,200
a power dynamic that still exists with you know 
smaller uh uh non-free software developers whether

30
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:16,240
that's like a game company or something like that 
Um so what the FSF does uh in all of its work is

31
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:23,360
to just educate the public about software freedom 
uh we founded to uh be the organizational home of

32
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,440
the canoe operating system which I'll touch on in 
a minute Um and so we're constantly talking about

33
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,120
free software is the only thing that we talk about 
Uh but it's it's it's good in that way because you

34
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:42,080
know as more as life becomes digital more and more 
uh free software becomes increasingly relevant So

35
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,120
it's you know never a dull moment when it comes 
to advocating for free software Um and something

36
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:54,960
that we do as part of that is we do our entire 
work from top down completely with free software

37
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:02,160
running on free bioses on machines that are often 
very old uh but they are the state-of-the-art

38
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,600
when it comes to freedom and as we are the free 
software foundation are one of our like main goals

39
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:14,080
and we don't state it maybe as often as we should 
is that you know we want to show people that it's

40
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,560
possible to run a reasonably sized organization 
using entirely free software with not using any

41
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,120
non-free software at all so that's that's one 
of the thing that we do um so the FSF is kind

42
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,000
of broadly split into a few different teams Uh I'm 
the campaigns manager of course There's also the

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,040
licensing team and the tech team There's a kind 
of secret other team called the operations team

44
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,600
which handles the mail and stuff like that Um but 
the FSF licensing team is the steward of the canoe

45
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,760
general public license the GPL which is the most 
popular uh copy left license in use today Copy

46
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:56,240
left of course means that uh if you get a program 
that is under a copy left license you are legally

47
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:03,120
obligated to give any user downstream any user you 
know who b who may benefit from your changes the

48
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,120
freedom to uh do the same things that you did 
when you received the program Um and we defend

49
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,840
copyright on the GNU operating system So GNU is 
a uh is an operating system It's a collection of

50
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:23,920
many many many different packages uh all of those 
packages are uh their copyright is held by the FSF

51
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:30,480
so that you know if we're ever in a position to 
where we need to defend um the the GPL you know

52
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,880
if if a uh if the downstream developer of 
a program should be releasing uh the source

53
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,880
code because a pro a canoe program is licensed 
under the GPL but they're choosing not to do that

54
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,280
uh then that's where we would become involved 
and you know hopefully resolve it amicably but

55
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,040
may end up going to court or what have you Can 
you maintain or something and I could not do it

56
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,320
because I had I got I got together a list of like 
500 people and I realized like oh this is too much

57
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,800
for one person or even the threeperson campaigns 
team We have to figure out something different

58
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,680
And of course there's my favorite GNU uh project 
my favorite free software program generally GNU

59
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:15,920
AAX which is but I wrote this presentation in So 
uh it's okay if he is a guy Uh but I I can make

60
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:22,000
um and like I mentioned before the EPF considers 
proprietary software to be a social injustice Full

61
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,360
stop Right Um you should never force someone 
to use proprietary software You should never

62
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:34,240
be forced to use proprietary software And uh 
something that often gets miscommunicated around

63
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:41,360
this is this idea that like if I am you know 
say that I'm an average free software person

64
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,800
and I'm using a GNU Linux operating system uh 
but it's not fully free you know I may be using

65
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,960
the non-free firmware that comes with the Linux 
kernel or something like this There's often this

66
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,000
like strange feeling of guilt right like I I I 
know that I should be using free software fully

67
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,600
free software but I can't and I feel bad about 
that Well you shouldn't feel bad about that right

68
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:09,600
like you're you're the victim in that scenario Um 
you you know it's it's important to be using the

69
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,560
free software that you can at all times you know 
because it's the best for your freedom But if you

70
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,040
can't you know that's not something that you're 
doing wrong It's something wrong that's being done

71
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:26,080
to you Uh and that's something that the FSF is 
trying to kind of uh campaign more around lately

72
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:32,480
And on that note you know the licensing team that 
stewards uh the GPL is also in charge of the FSF's

73
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:38,400
respect your freedom initiative Uh that's way for 
manufacturers to certify that the hardware that

74
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,960
you have uh runs fully free software So basically 
they submit devices to the stuff the licensing

75
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,680
team very uh intently studies those devices to 
make sure that they are fully free software that

76
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,840
all of the software running on them is fully 
free and that they're compatible with fully

77
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,560
free software Um so some examples of this are of 
course the refurbished laptops that the FSF uses

78
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,800
uh themselves but there are also you know um 
larger more expensive computers like those uh

79
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,960
like the Talos 2 a lot of things running the power 
9 CPU architecture if those words mean anything to

80
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,720
you Um and places where you would least expect 
but we're the first to admit that there is

81
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:30,800
uh far less fully free uh software compatible 
hardware than there ought to be right like the FSF

82
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,680
wants a world where you can go down to the local 
store and the computer that you purchased is just

83
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,040
immediately configured with fully free software 
all of the device drivers in it are compatible

84
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:48,640
with fully free software That's not a world that 
we are uh anywhere near getting to but these is

85
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:56,240
going to continue to exist for as long as it will 
take to get there I'm 100% confident of that Um

86
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,320
but part of what the campaigns team does you know 
it's it's it's it's kind of strange right because

87
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:09,440
we are this threeperson team The FSIF is 10 
staffers uh in total but the campaigns team is is

88
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:16,160
three people of that of which I'm one of them And 
we are up against literally billions of dollars

89
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:24,400
in marketing from proprietary software companies 
right uh like Microsoft like Apple Google X you

90
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:31,120
know whatever it is Uh that's a lot of that's a 
lot of like advertising money but it's against

91
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,960
uh us or against you know not only us but every 
other free software uh person campaigning for

92
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,760
free software and so it's important that we 
you know like solidify our principles as much

93
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,680
as possible and that we like I mentioned before be 
talking about free software all the time you know

94
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,840
essentially um where wherever we can because 
somehow you know everything becomes a free

95
00:09:53,840 --> 00:10:01,200
software issue at some deployed uh just by virtue 
of how much technology is is in the world today Um

96
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,040
but something else that we do is you know the FSF 
uh campaigns team is the main point of connection

97
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,560
with the global free software community So if you 
send a message to the episte typically an email

98
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:19,440
right um the campaign team will probably be the 
people who are answering you unless it's a kind of

99
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,360
uh you know financial thing Um and so you know 
part of that part of what I do especially is

100
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:32,320
just constantly keeping up in developments in 
proprietary software more often than free software

101
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:39,040
right because there's always something about to 
happen or happening that is you know something

102
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,720
that the Avat needs to talk about And that's a lot 
of what I do Of course we write articles we share

103
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,680
software freedom uh however we can with whoever 
we can Um and that's you know the campaign team

104
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:58,480
work in a nutshell Touching back on this feeling 
of guilt that I just mentioned uh something that

105
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,640
these is working toward in particular is this uh 
campaign called the freedom ladder which we've

106
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,960
been developing for some time now Um and it's 
it's it's important to highlight that you know

107
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:19,280
anytime any single time in your life when you say 
no to a non-free program So when you know if if

108
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:26,000
theoretically if I were asked to give this call 
on Zoom and I said no that would be a win for the

109
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,200
free software movement right because I refuse to 
free soft uh to use non-free software and I told

110
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,960
someone about it you know they know now that I am 
that person who will annoy them because I refuse

111
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:43,760
to use proprietary software Every time that you do 
that is a net win for the free software movement

112
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,080
That's something that the freedom ladder is really 
trying to highlight right um it's in a nutshell

113
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:57,040
what we envision it to be is a way that people 
can say like okay I am on an Android phone you

114
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:03,120
know maybe I use a custom distribution of Android 
like Lineage OS or something like that but I want

115
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:10,480
to use more free apps or I I'm on iOS and I want 
to use more free apps like what do I do know the

116
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,480
freedom bladder what we want it to be is is a 
guide in that way like okay if you're here then

117
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,760
try doing this if you're here try doing this 
and if you're at the very end for some reason

118
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,160
uh you know congratulations but if you're at 
the very end you know help somebody else get

119
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,640
to the very end because that's the free software 
movement is going to succeed you know that's kind

120
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:36,240
of how we've gotten to this point uh already 
the long-term goal of the campaigns team right

121
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,640
now is to launch a comprehensive site about that 
that is proving to be a little bit more difficult

122
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:49,280
uh than we thought because we you know want to 
have it as easily accessible as possible to people

123
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:57,120
who are not in the free software world already you 
know um the freedom ladder initiative like once it

124
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:04,080
is fully launched you know you should not have 
to know words like kernel firmware binary blob

125
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,440
uh proprietary all of these terms that you know 
jargon that we throw around the average person

126
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:16,240
just doesn't isn't familiar with this right if you 
if you use the word firmware to someone uh walking

127
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,640
down the street today there's a pretty good chance 
that they would not know what you were talking

128
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:28,160
about right um and so you know communicating about 
that is really difficult because if you if you're

129
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,600
trying to share free software with somebody and 
you have to start that conversation by giving

130
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,480
the definition for about nine different terms or 
something like that that person is going to tune

131
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:47,200
out very quickly You know I've seen it happen like 
over 100 times I'm I'm going to say uh where you

132
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:53,440
know like somebody who's kind of new to advocating 
for free software let's say like oh well a binary

133
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,800
block is blah blah blah a firmware is blah blah 
blah and by the time that they actually get to the

134
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,440
point that they're trying to deliver that person 
has just tuned out and all they want to do is get

135
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,040
out of the conversation uh communicating about 
free software effectively especially to someone

136
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,880
who isn't technical is one of the most important 
and one of the most difficult things you can do as

137
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,000
a free software uh supporter So that's why we're 
kind of still working on the freedom ladder still

138
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
trying to get it out there in a way that um you 
know is accessible to as many people possible

139
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,400
working very hard on that but it is not really 
yet a um and I'm going to go through a few other

140
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:38,480
FS campaigns before I kind of talk about uh Libra 
Planet and the Libra Planet community in general

141
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,760
One of our biggest ones is of course affected by 
design which is our campaign against uh digital

142
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:50,720
restrictions management DRM The film industry 
the video game industry the music industry will

143
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:57,520
often use another word for DRM Uh I'm going to say 
that word Uh because what it really is is digital

144
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:04,080
restrictions management right you are being 
restricted There is someone in an office somewhere

145
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:10,800
in Redmond Washington who is trying to figure out 
how can I get how can I prevent user from sharing

146
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:17,040
window can I prevent users from you know sharing 
the next version of whatever proprietary software

147
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:24,160
we're going to come out with uh which is it's 
a free software issue in so far as you know if

148
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:32,480
DRM existed in free software um it would just be 
written out because no user wants to be controlled

149
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,480
and what they can or can't do with a piece of 
media what they can or can't do with a program

150
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:46,000
um like you know one one uh example that we've 
been using more and more frequently is this

151
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,800
uh you know streaming services at least in the 
United ates you're often kind of prohibited by the

152
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:59,760
uh browser typically from taking a screenshot 
I mean it's a screenshot like who cares right

153
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:09,520
uh that's DRM and and you know no sane person 
would uh enjoy that feature right it's it DRM

154
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,960
is comprised of anti-features Uh and why it's a 
free software issue is because it's implemented

155
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,520
through non-free software right because if it 
weren't people would just strip it out and say

156
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,800
you know here here's my version of you know 
Google Widevine uh level you know whatever

157
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:31,680
the highest level is that will uh allow you to 
take screenshots or what have you you know Um

158
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,760
and and so it's important to be uh campaigning 
against DRM you know as much as we can because

159
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:43,520
streaming services are only becoming more and 
more entrenched in society uh there's you know

160
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:51,120
streaming services it does not function in any way 
differently from downloading a file uh period The

161
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,760
only difference is that you know that file is 
being handled in a particular manner and being

162
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:02,400
deleted you know immediately after it's it's been 
uh seen or streamed heard whatever and since it's

163
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:08,880
a file it should be uh you know subject to the 
same rules that any other file is And that's

164
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:16,560
uh DRM why you might want to refuse to use it Um 
and there's a there's a kind of often there's an

165
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:22,160
overlap between people who are uh uh free software 
people and people who are very concerned about

166
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,520
their privacy You know one FSF talking point that 
you may have heard is that you cannot have true

167
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:34,080
privacy with a free software Right if you're using 
a um you know encrypted messenger and they don't

168
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:40,160
exactly share how their encryption is being done 
you know I'm thinking of WhatsApp when I say this

169
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,400
uh that's that's a prompt that they're making 
to you is you know is is a company like Meta

170
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:53,360
known for keeping their promises or known for uh 
speaking accurately about things like that you

171
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,520
know you might you might have a different opinion 
I'm going to say no they aren't trustworthy and

172
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,560
so you know privacy is is is something that you 
can only verify if you're running free software

173
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:07,760
on that program Uh and to that end you know 
part of the FSF's work is to encourage more

174
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:15,520
people to encrypt their communications Um 
because starting with um in the early 2000s

175
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,840
we became kind of more and more interested in 
opposing bulk surveillance right as thei as the

176
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,680
uh intelligence agencies in the United States you 
know be kept kind of collecting more and more data

177
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:33,920
uh the FSF began to advocate for encrypting your 
communications as much as possible So we set up

178
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:42,000
a guide to encrypting your email uh called email 
self-defense It's that at that URL right there Um

179
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,600
so that's another initiative that we have Um 
but there's there's like one you know pretty

180
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:54,480
major problem facing uh free software people in 
today right like okay I'm going to boot up my

181
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,960
fully free distribution of GNU Linux I'm going to 
open up a browser and I'm going to go to you know

182
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,560
uh docs.google.com right well okay If I 
go there I'm going to immediately be be

183
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:14,240
downloading like a 100 megabyte file of uh 
proprietary JavaScript all in one extremely

184
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:21,520
uh long line of minified JavaScript that no 
programmer is just really capable of reading right

185
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:29,040
and so we're kind of getting to the point as uh 
as a you know computing society I guess where

186
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:38,320
um less than the OS right so when that's the 
case you know you need to be able to inspect

187
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,400
the JavaScript uh running on your computer right 
and which you can do right even right now I can go

188
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:51,200
to Google Docs I can you know rightclick and say 
view source or whatever and I will see the you

189
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:59,280
what is nominally the the source code to Google 
Docs but it is is just so intensely uh obiscated

190
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:06,640
and made deliberately vague by running through 
uh you know a few different programs um that it's

191
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:13,040
just not source code in any kind of useful sense 
of that word So to that end you know the FSF uh

192
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:19,040
encourages the development of a particular browser 
extension called Libra.js JS which will uh you

193
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:26,320
know if you visit a site it will check for license 
headers in the um in the top of the JavaScript

194
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:34,720
file It knows um different ways to uh you know 
give different signs of offiscated JavaScript It's

195
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:43,920
able to detect that It's not perfect uh there are 
uh there's at least one major um you know way of

196
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:50,800
recording JavaScript licenses that Librajs cannot 
do yet It's being worked on um but it's not there

197
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,040
yet But you know if you're a free software person 
and you're thinking about these issues you can't

198
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:00,800
ignore JavaScript because JavaScript uh as much as 
someone like me is horrified by the idea it's here

199
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:07,520
to stay right it's not going anywhere Um so it's 
an important kind of vector to consider in your

200
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:14,720
free software advocacy for sure Um that brings 
me to what the Libra Planet Network is right so

201
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,480
there's all of these ways that you can support 
free software all of these ways that you can

202
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:26,080
be talking about free software but how exactly do 
you do that where would you go you know are there

203
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:32,640
other people who can help you do this and you 
know if you're watching this you were at some

204
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,240
kind of gathering of these people right now If you 
weren't you know if you were just one person who

205
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,760
you know one night found out about free software 
found out about GNU Linux what would you do you

206
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,720
know uh if you wanted to share that with people 
you could do a one-on-one advocacy or you could

207
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,880
network with people And from the beginning 
Libra Planet Network is what the FSF uh you

208
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:02,960
know it's its kind of own way of facilitating 
communication What it looks like basically um

209
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:10,160
so what it is I mean literally it's a media wiki 
instance uh and the wiki is about free software

210
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:18,080
from start to finish Um how it began is the FSF 
has an annual conference also called Libra Planet

211
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,480
um which but that's only once a year right so you 
need you know you can't just be advocating for

212
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,680
for software once a year You need to be doing it 
constantly if it's if it's going to be gaining any

213
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:35,680
kind of traction Um and so Libra planet started I 
mean essentially as a way to for people to network

214
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:42,560
uh based on where they live right so one of 
the main parts of Libraet is uh a map and you

215
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,280
can click your country and then it kind of gets 
a little bit more fine grain from there to to

216
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:54,400
network with free software people Um and that's 
opposed to you know quote unquote open source

217
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:03,360
people Libra Libra planet is a way of organizing 
or is a is a medium of organizing that uh you know

218
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,920
the people who you might meet there who you would 
collaborate with there are people who prioritize

219
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:15,680
you know the message of freedom rather than the 
message of like oh it will be technically better

220
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:22,000
you know better on a technical level if the source 
code to your program were free well I mean that

221
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,080
might be true but it also might not be true right 
the main advantage is of uh freedom of of of you

222
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,920
know enjoying your freedom of having control over 
your own life Um and so the liver planet network

223
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:41,520
is is you know what it is is a uh a gathering of 
those of that particular kind of person of that

224
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,640
particular kind of free software activist and a 
place for them to network with the other So you

225
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:53,280
know what in practice would that look like you 
know say like you've um signed up to the labor

226
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,480
planet.org quickie You've kind of browsed around a 
little bit but what do you do from there well you

227
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,360
know a lot of it would look like what you're doing 
right now essentially like hosting meetups like

228
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:09,680
this one you know sharing ad strategies on how to 
advocate for free software There are uh a lot of

229
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,480
interesting pages on libupplanet.org where people 
have thought through these questions particularly

230
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:23,440
in the freedom ladder Um you know freedom ladder 
we started developing it in 2020 I think of

231
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,520
uh you know this series of conversations like okay 
we are the FSF we always want to be prioritizing

232
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:36,000
freedom but how do we do that you know on a 
practical level how can we effectively communicate

233
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,760
uh the next step to what people's you know own 
personal journey to freedom would look like Libra

234
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,240
planet it's the natural place to do that because 
that's where we collaborate That's where we know

235
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,680
where the people who care about free software are 
You know the most thing the thing that we've done

236
00:24:53,680 --> 00:25:01,520
most recently of course is uh on October 4th 2025 
the FSF turns 40 years old We've been encouraging

237
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:09,760
people to host meetups um about free software not 
necessarily about the FSF Inspect the JavaScript

238
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,560
uh running on your computer right and which you 
can do right even right now I can go to Google

239
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:21,280
Docs I can you know rightclick and say view source 
or whatever and I will see the you know what is

240
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:29,760
nominally the the source code to Google Docs but 
it is is just so intensely uh obiscated and made

241
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:36,480
deliberately vague by running through uh you 
know a few different programs um that it's just

242
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,320
not source code in any kind of useful sense 
of that word So to that end you know the FSF

243
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,400
uh encourages the development of a particular 
browser extension called Libra.js which will

244
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:55,520
uh you know if you visit a site it will check 
for license headers in the um in the top of the

245
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:03,600
JavaScript file it knows um different ways to 
uh you know have different signs of offiscated

246
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:11,200
JavaScript It's able to detect that It's not 
perfect Uh there are uh there's at least one major

247
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:19,280
um you know way of recording JavaScript licenses 
that Librajs cannot do yet It's being worked on

248
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,200
um but it's not there yet But you know if you're 
a free software person and you're thinking about

249
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,960
these issues you can't ignore JavaScript because 
JavaScript as much as someone like me is horrified

250
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:36,160
by the idea it's here to stay right it's not going 
anywhere Um so it's an important kind of vector to

251
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:42,720
consider in your free software advocacy for sure 
Um that brings me to what the Libra planet network

252
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,920
is right so there's all of these ways that you 
can support free software all of these ways that

253
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:55,200
you can be talking about free software but how 
exactly do you do that where would you go you

254
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:01,520
know are there other people who can help you 
do this and you know if you're watching this

255
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,160
you were at some kind of gathering of these people 
right now If you weren't you know if you were just

256
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:12,800
one person who you know one night found out about 
free software found out about GNU Linux what would

257
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,840
you do you know uh if you wanted to share that 
with people you could do a one-on-one advocacy

258
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:24,080
or you could network with people And from the 
beginning the Libra planet network is what the FSF

259
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:30,960
uh you know it's its kind of own way of 
facilitating communication what it looks like

260
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:39,440
basically Um so what it is I mean literally it's a 
media wiki instance uh and the wiki is about free

261
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:46,560
software from start to finish Um how it began is 
the FSF has an annual conference also called Liber

262
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:52,160
Planet Um which but that's only once a year right 
so you need you know you can't just be advocating

263
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,640
for free software once a year You need to be 
doing it constantly if it's if it's going to

264
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:03,440
be gaining any kind of traction Um and so Libra 
Bunnet started I mean essentially as a way to

265
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:10,400
for people to network uh based on where they live 
right so what are the main parts of Liberet it's

266
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:15,840
uh a map and you can click your country and then 
it kind of gets a little bit more fine grain from

267
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:23,600
there to to network with free software people 
Um and that's opposed to you know quote unquote

268
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:32,720
open source people Libra Libra planet is a way of 
organizing or is a is a medium of organizing that

269
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,560
you know the people who you might meet there who 
you would collaborate with there are people who

270
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:44,560
prioritize you know the message of freedom rather 
than the message of like oh it will be technically

271
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:51,200
better you know better on a technical level if 
the source code to your program were free Well

272
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,240
I mean that might be true but it also might 
not be true right the main advantage is of

273
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:02,640
uh freedom of of of you know enjoying your freedom 
of having control over your own life Um and so the

274
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:10,320
Libra Planet Network is is you know what it is is 
a uh a gathering of those of that particular kind

275
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,360
of person of that particular kind of free software 
activist and a place for them to network with each

276
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:22,720
other So you know what in practice would that look 
like you know say like you've um signed up to the

277
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,000
libranet.org wiki you've kind of browsed around 
a little bit but what do you do from there well

278
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,880
you know a lot of it would look like what you're 
doing right now essentially like hosting meetups

279
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:39,280
like this one you know sharing ad strategies on 
how to advocate for free software There are a lot

280
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:44,240
of interesting pages on libranet.org where people 
have thought through these questions particularly

281
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:53,120
in the freedom ladder um you know freedom ladder 
we started developing it in 2020 I think of

282
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:59,200
uh you know this series of conversations like okay 
we are the FSF we always want to be prioritizing

283
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:05,680
freedom but how do we do that you know on a 
practical level how can we effectively communicate

284
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:13,520
uh the next step to what people's you know own 
personal journey to freedom would look like Libra

285
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,000
planet's the natural place to do that because 
that's where we collaborate That's where we know

286
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,360
where the people who care about free software are 
You know the most thing the thing that we've done

287
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:31,200
most recently of course is uh on October 4th 2025 
the FSF turns 40 years old We've been encouraging

288
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:38,960
people to host meetups um about free software not 
necessarily about the FSF just to kind of show the

289
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:46,720
wider world uh how far free software has come you 
know it's not just that GNU Linux powers the bulk

290
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,520
of you know the servers running the internet or 
something like that It's that it's really made

291
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:59,520
this like positive impact over countless people 
Um and that's something that we want to celebrate

292
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:05,120
right like that's something that we want to uh 
which we need to celebrate if free software is

293
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,800
going to you know go further than it has right 
now because right now more people are using free

294
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:16,400
software than ever before but they don't know 
that they're using free software Um and I'll

295
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:24,320
touch on that in a second Here it is Um mobile 
phone freedom So you know there are right now

296
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:30,480
uh particularly or yeah particularly if you have 
any Android phone there are probably programs in

297
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:37,760
it that are copyrighted by the FSF Um or that at 
least are licensed under the GNU General public

298
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:44,000
license not on iOS but licensed under some free 
software licenses pro most likely one of our free

299
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,680
software licenses um you know anything that 
runs the Kel Linux it is licensed under the

300
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:57,680
GPL v2 which is a license that we wrote in 1991 
um and so anytime anyone activates a phone for

301
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:03,680
the first time they're using free software that's 
success in some way you know they're you literally

302
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:09,360
using the program but they're still oppressed 
right they're still being um they still don't

303
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:18,000
have software freedom they deserve free software 
there's nothing at all um intrinsically different

304
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,880
from phone and a computer A phone is a computer 
It should run free software The FSF believes that

305
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,360
every computer should run free software right and 
of course it becomes a little bit more complicated

306
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:36,720
than that because uh you know behind iOS or 
behind Android there operating system called

307
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,240
the bassband operating system I won't go into 
that too much but you know that is one way that

308
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,640
the that that the phone phones are a little bit 
more complicated than than uh computers but on a

309
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,360
on an ethical level you know there's no separation 
You should run be able to run fully free software

310
00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:00,880
on your phone Um and the kind of way that that 
looks right now is Android is nominally free

311
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:07,200
software right you might have heard of something 
called the AOSP or the Android open source project

312
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:14,480
um as it comes out you know that's free software 
the problem is when it gets combined with you

313
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,840
know first of all the the bassband operating 
system of which as far as I know there is no

314
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:26,880
free software bassband operating system uh that 
could power the radio communications of a phone

315
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,320
um but more than that you know when Android 
gets paired with uh the Google Play services

316
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:40,000
for example or when Android gets paired with 
uh most often you basic device drivers like the

317
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,160
uh even something as simple as lighting up 
a screen or you know turning on and off a

318
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:52,880
Bluetooth network card will typically involve 
running some non-free firmware Um why that's

319
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,240
done you know we could talk about it for a long 
time but it's kind of just the way that the

320
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:05,600
uh you know device peripheral uh industry works 
essentially right it's it's what they've done

321
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:14,640
they have no real impetus to change that Um but 
you know there are ways to run a more or less

322
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:19,840
free phone The best that we can do right now 
is a project that uh the FSF sponsor is called

323
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:26,240
Replicant It's a free distribution of Android and 
at this point it's an interesting project but runs

324
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:34,560
on very few devices There was a short amount of 
time where we were able to recommend it Um but as

325
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:41,280
uh the networks the mobile networks that the 
phones that ran replicant uh kind of closed

326
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,920
down over time like the you know the deprecation 
of 3G in particular It's it's it's not really a

327
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:53,600
phone at this point anymore The devices that run 
it basically become tablets because they you know

328
00:34:53,600 --> 00:35:00,960
uh use outdated um you know mobile phone 
radio communications But you know it's it's

329
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,560
an interesting project Of course there are other 
things like uh the uh hobbyist projects like the

330
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:12,160
Librim 5 or you know the Pine Phone things 
like that Uh our perspective is that those

331
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:18,160
are interesting projects but we haven't had the 
opportunity to evaluate any kind of you know

332
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:26,720
quote unquote Linux phone um on a on a on a really 
closely detailed level Although basically based on

333
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,720
you know the state-of-the-art right now there's 
almost no chance that it would be able to run

334
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:38,080
fully free software Um and another way that you 
can just kind of like use uh more and more free

335
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:45,040
media or communicate in more of a free way is to 
use federated social media right like so uh from

336
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:53,280
the last time that I gave this talk uh Twitter has 
changed it to X Twitter was also taken over by a

337
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:01,600
let's just say oligarch Um and you know it's it's 
it's kind of had its own kind of social challenges

338
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:09,200
but something to remember is that network services 
are neither free or nonfree They're just there You

339
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:15,360
know you are not necessarily doing anything 
to your software freedom rights in particular

340
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:20,560
if you're on a network service or if you're 
connecting to a website something like that

341
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,360
that's that's not something where free software 
really enters into play Um but where it does

342
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:32,560
matter is if you're supplied software thereby the 
server itself you know sending you JavaScript or

343
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:39,760
uh you know them necessitating that you use some 
kind of app whatever that software must be free

344
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:46,880
uh and so that's something that we'll always uh 
advocate around but on a practical level you know

345
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,960
uh independent of free software the FSF is 
interested in helping people avoid government

346
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,760
surveillance especially bulk government 
surveillance like the NSA in the United

347
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:03,760
States practices Um and to that end you know 
we recommend the use of federated social media

348
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:11,200
platforms wherever possible Um do they escape bulk 
surveillance no But what they do do is they you

349
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:19,360
know kind of diversify the uh points of failure 
more or less It's like if Elon shuts X down

350
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:25,920
tomorrow for whatever you know bananas reason he 
might come up with uh where would all that go it

351
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:32,720
would it would go away But if you were federated 
you know I have a a server in my house right now

352
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:39,920
uh that is running a federated social media 
instance right and you know if I run in my

353
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,800
bedroom and my neighbor runs it and so on and so 
on you know no one can take down that network no

354
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,800
matter how hard they try So in the interest of 
you know helping people to avoid censorship that

355
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,440
is something that the FSF has been focused on 
for a long time you know encouraging people to

356
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:01,760
use federated social media uh like Mastadon Uh we 
haven't had the chance to look into blue sky too

357
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:08,800
closely We understand that it can be used with 
fully free software Um but beyond reading the

358
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:15,440
API I have not done as much blue sky research as 
I probably should have I confess to that Um but

359
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:23,520
any network based on the activity pro protocol 
like uh pleoma you know miskey things like that

360
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,800
um you know they're going to have the same benefit 
that maston does We recommend Raston because it's

361
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:37,840
um the most widespread at at the moment Um and 
it's it's licensed under the AGPL uh which of

362
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:43,600
course we wrote um which is a version of the 
GPL v3 that's specifically intended for software

363
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:51,360
served over the network Um so we can advocate 
for maston you know because of that Um but you

364
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:58,560
know independent of like uh specific programs or 
telling people how do I uh you know you should use

365
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:04,960
social uh federated social media or you should 
use a freeer phone or free apps if you can How

366
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:12,560
do you do it in general i mean and the way that 
we've found successful uh over our long history

367
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,120
and the way that I found successful you know 
even before I worked at the FSF when I was just

368
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:25,200
a random free software uh advocate essentially 
is just to encourage people to say no The the

369
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:32,160
the hardest thing to do it seems is to just say 
no to a non-free program like I mentioned earlier

370
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:40,000
Um and there's a very insidious network effect to 
that right like if I am a student and I'm required

371
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:48,480
to use uh you know Zoom or if I'm required to take 
my exam through this non-free uh program that will

372
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,960
you know incidentally spy on me the entire time 
I'm doing my exam Uh what do I do and this you

373
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:01,840
know this is a very serious problem The FSF hears 
from students uh I would say you know at least a

374
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:07,280
few times a year where there's the student who's 
required to use proprietary software for their

375
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:15,200
schooling and you know is unsure what to do and 
it's very difficult to know like what to recommend

376
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:21,520
in that situation right we've had students who say 
like I will take an F in this course because I an

377
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,920
F in the United States is the lowest uh grade that 
you can possibly get I don't know if that carries

378
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,840
it right here um but you know I will I will fail 
this of course intentionally because I want to

379
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:37,120
take a stand There are people in the world who do 
that and that's you know impressive but we can't

380
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:43,200
all be doing that and that's why we need to kind 
of just normalize saying no to a non-free program

381
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:50,240
That's one of the best things that you can do 
Um and we need to be advocating in free programs

382
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:59,200
uh as a kind of positive advocacy where we can 
right like there's uh it requires some tact

383
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:06,000
right especially in you know the early 2000s when 
new Linux just wasn't completely there yet it's

384
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,000
debatable whether um you know you were really 
doing effective free software advocacy if you

385
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,720
said oh you should try you know GNU Linux You have 
to spend about three hours setting it up and you

386
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:25,520
have to buy this particular graphics card and you 
have to you know edit the MBR boot record of your

387
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,400
motherboard of your hard drive in such a way that 
you know blah blah blah this goes on for an hour

388
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:37,920
Um you know did that really help the free software 
movement i mean yes but you you need to have tact

389
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:43,360
um when you choose the things to recommend 
especially when they're to people who are not free

390
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:51,360
software people or who are not immediately going 
to be persuaded by the ethical argument Um and you

391
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:57,520
know the way to do that is just to to to find what 
programs or what apps are the most well polished

392
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:03,520
for the normal person and to say you know hey have 
you tried this one uh example of this you know

393
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:12,480
Microsoft has uh Office 365 which is kind of what 
they've collapsed uh Microsoft Word into And you

394
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,680
know if somebody's in the position where they're 
like "Oh I need to pay for this subscription and I

395
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:23,600
don't want to you know what do I do?" One program 
you can easily recommend in in that situation is

396
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:29,760
to say "Oh no Don't use Office 365 and Microsoft 
Word Use Libre Office and Libre Office Writer."

397
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:36,080
you know it's good to have a kind of working 
vocabulary of uh what programs are effective

398
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:43,440
to to to tell about to tell people about you know 
in that way and like I mentioned before you know

399
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,800
a lot of the time there is technical advantage 
to using a free software and that I mean that

400
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,640
uh the the free software program is technically 
on a technical level better you know it may have

401
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:00,640
more features it may be more stable uh you know 
run on more oper operating systems whatever But

402
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:07,920
a lot of the times that's not the case You know 
a a free software program that is targeting some

403
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:18,400
kind of you know obscure field um may not be 
as polished as the one that um the proprietary

404
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:24,080
one right like we see this a lot especially in 
in media production but it was more of a thing

405
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:30,720
uh a while back right like for a while uh you know 
the [ __ ] was not in the [ __ ] is the GNU image

406
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:36,320
uh manipulation program the uh the [ __ ] was not 
in a place where we could say you know oh if you

407
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:41,520
use Photoshop you should just switch to [ __ ] 
right because it has all the same things that

408
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:47,600
wasn't 100% true you know as 10 years ago or 
something like that which was a lot better now

409
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:54,640
but what do you do in situations where the free 
program isn't as you know typically better as

410
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:01,280
uh the free program as the non-free program Um and 
in that moment you just have to kind of assess the

411
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:07,120
situation right you have to kind of think to 
yourself uh okay if I advocate for this free

412
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:13,360
program to this person if I tell them to use you 
know let's just say uh let's go with Libra Office

413
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:19,120
If I tell them to use Libre Office how is that 
going to go you know are they more likely to use

414
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:24,640
it and have positive experience and then want to 
use more free software or are they more likely to

415
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,760
say like "Oh my god I know this free software 
stuff is is too much for me You know I'm just

416
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,360
going to stick with Windows and Microsoft Word 
and blah blah blah." It's important to know how

417
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:41,280
to navigate that situation to and to you know able 
to think about that on the fly when you're just

418
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:47,280
having a conversation with people That's something 
that you know we at the FSF have had the privilege

419
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,160
of doing it because that's what we do all day But 
if you're just a student or if you're just you

420
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:58,080
know uh like an accountant somewhere or something 
the only way that you're going to develop that is

421
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:04,080
through practice And the way to get more practice 
is to network with as many free software people

422
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:11,440
um as you can So knowing that is important But 
if you're if you really don't know what to do

423
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:17,360
uh the way that what what I personally think you 
should do this is not an FSF position exactly What

424
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,840
I think you should do is just to kind of always 
emphasize the ethical If you don't know what to

425
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:27,680
do emphasize the ethical because you know that's 
something where we will always have the advantage

426
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:35,040
over non-free software Period Um we will always be 
in a position where we can say you know if you use

427
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:41,120
this program you can share it with other people If 
you use this program you can know empirically and

428
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:48,640
for a fact that it is not spying on you when you 
can't know that with the other program Uh knowing

429
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:54,800
those situations and knowing how to navigate them 
is you know very important So if all else fails

430
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:01,120
you know key to the ethical it will sometimes get 
you where you need to go Um but that's you know

431
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:05,360
talking about free software is not the only way 
that you help the free software movement You can

432
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:11,120
also volunteer And of course uh during this talk 
I've kind of harped a lot on local stuff because

433
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:17,600
you know I personally have had the most success 
in local stuff um even poor coming to the FSF

434
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:24,880
and the way to really get people passionate about 
free software I found it's to kind of take them

435
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:30,480
or help them you know better not better than 
taking them you can help them take themselves

436
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,080
uh to this you know greater place of freedom to 
using more and more free software becoming a free

437
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:42,560
software advocate Uh you know one-on-one 
communication face to face is just really

438
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:48,560
unparalleled when it comes to that particular 
thing Um and of course that's why we Libra Planet

439
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:54,560
Wiki to kind of help people coordinate uh not 
only online meetups but one-on-one meetups Those

440
00:46:54,560 --> 00:47:00,480
are the ones that we really like to see But you 
know we also want to the FSF is very focused on

441
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,160
spreading you know the concept of free software 
but we also just we're free software people We

442
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:12,480
use free software all day So we want the programs 
themselves to get better Um and to that end you

443
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,480
know we recommend that people get involved in 
their favorite free software project you know

444
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:22,480
the one that they use every day whether it's just 
filing bugs or write writing documentation or you

445
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:30,240
know contributing 2,000 lines of ANC to whatever 
program you're using You know wherever you're at

446
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:34,960
there almost definitely something that you can do 
for the free software program that you you know

447
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:40,960
are particularly passionate about or that you use 
more than others Um and I encourage you to kind of

448
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:46,560
like try and figure that out A lot of the times 
you know the bug trackers of these programs will

449
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:53,200
have bugs that are uh tagged you know beginner 
or newcomer or something like that And they're

450
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:59,200
ways that the maintainers signal to people that 
okay this is like a this is an issue that a you

451
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:05,440
know reasonably motivated newcomer to our project 
who's never contributed to you know GNU geeks or

452
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:11,280
whatever uh could tackle by themselves finding 
those like a really good way to get started

453
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:17,760
um in contributing to a free software project 
itself and uh you know just kind of furthering

454
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:26,160
free software in a way that's not um spreading 
the message exactly Uh but if you want to support

455
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:31,600
the FSF in particular the way that you do that the 
best way you can do that is you know unfortunately

456
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:39,440
it's true it's financial Um you can become an 
associate member of the FSF Uh so some people

457
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,400
think I talked to them that the FSF has a lot of 
corporate sponsorship because you know of course

458
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,760
we uh hold the copyright to GNU and write the GPL 
and blah blah blah That is absolutely not true

459
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:57,200
Over 90% of the FSF's funding comes from associate 
members It comes from people you know giving their

460
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:04,080
annual donation to the FSF that signals to us like 
yes there are people out there in the world who

461
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:08,960
uh you know use free software who are running 
free software and they're signaling to us that

462
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,480
they support us the other in our work for free 
software um so if you want to support the other

463
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:20,320
in particular what you can do is uh become an 
associate member that will help us a lot um and

464
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:25,680
in addition to this kind of like very positive 
feeling of well of well-being that you will get

465
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:30,480
uh you will also get some cool stuff you know it 
will get you access to our Jity meet server so

466
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:37,200
you can do uh encrypted voice calls um our 
member forum and a bootable USB card with

467
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:42,720
uh Triscoll GNU Linux pre-installed that's a 
fully free distribution of GNU Linux and you

468
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:50,560
can do that at that URL fsf.org uh/join 
and I think that's it for uh in terms

469
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:58,400
of slides um thanks for the invite uh it was 
short notice but I hope that I you know have

470
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:05,520
given you a perspective to consider that you have 
not uh done so already There was probably some

471
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:10,400
uh overlap there in terms of you know what 
already may know but we're very grateful for

472
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:15,040
the opportunity to speak to anyone anywhere 
about free software So thank you Delta for

473
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:21,600
contacting us Uh thanks to anyone involved 
coordinating this event Um you know it's

474
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:26,960
fun for me to always get to talk about yourself 
So thanks very much Happy hacking See you later
