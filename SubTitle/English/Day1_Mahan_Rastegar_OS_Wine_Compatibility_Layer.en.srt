‫[Music]
Hello, I'm Mahan and I'm interested in...‬

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:20,320
‫free software and Linux.
I use the Arch distribution.‬

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:29,240
‫and I'm very interested in Linux. I code with Python, Rust,
C, and MicroPython. My job is IoT.‬

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:37,079
‫I work at a knowledge-based company in Shiraz,
Jahanpars. And I'm a student at the University of...‬

7
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,160
‫Shiraz as well. My field is
Computer Science.‬

8
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:50,239
‫Okay, the first topic we want to talk
about is open source systems.‬

9
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,039
‫When we talk about open source systems, the first thing
that comes to our mind is Linux. Perhaps the only thing...‬

10
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,280
‫that comes to our mind in open source systems
is Linux.‬

11
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:06,840
‫But well, we have a lot of open source systems.
We also have different types of kernels that...‬

12
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,360
‫many people might not be aware of. One of the
most famous ones you've probably heard of is ...‬

13
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,240
‫BSDs: FreeBSD, OpenBSD,
NetBSD. Which also have very different applications...‬

14
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:25,920
‫They do. But Linux is
the strongest among them and has a very strong and...‬

15
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:33,119
‫large community behind it.
An open source system gives you the authority and freedom to...‬

16
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:39,320
‫use your system however you like. For example,‬

17
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:46,439
‫you can even
rewrite your device's lights yourself, if you want...‬

18
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,920
‫to redefine how they are used.
But in an operating system like Windows, you must use it...‬

19
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,479
‫exactly as defined, and outside of that,
it's very difficult to do anything...‬

20
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,799
‫else. Let's go to the next one.‬

21
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:11,520
‫Next: What is open source and why is it important?
The definition of open source is that everyone can...‬

22
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:20,120
‫see its code, everyone can change it and improve it.
And this causes your code's security to...‬

23
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:28,920
‫increase significantly, and the level of trust in your code to rise.
If one day, the community that uses it...‬

24
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:36,319
‫is very large or you have a very technical community...
Why is it important for us to...‬

25
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:44,519
‫support open source systems? Because
we provide a culture and a freedom of choice to...‬

26
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:53,280
‫users to use their device, their machine,
and however they are interested...‬

27
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:04,200
‫to use it. And at the same level, we also create some
limitations for them.‬

28
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:15,040
‫For example, if a very specific program like
Photoshop is very useful in Windows,‬

29
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:22,760
‫in Linux there is something like GIMP, but there are some
uses that are only available in Photoshop.‬

30
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:29,439
‫Today, after this presentation, I'm going to introduce you
to something called Wine, which allows you to run Windows...‬

31
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,200
‫programs in Linux as well.‬

32
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,640
‫You might not be able to run very new versions, but you
can definitely use older versions, and your device...‬

33
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:47,400
‫becomes almost completely unnecessary to dual boot
Windows, run a virtual machine, or use Linux in any other way.‬

34
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,920
‫If I want to give you an example of an open source system...
A little higher... They say even higher is more attractive...‬

35
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,079
‫Let's give an example... A little higher... Ah, they say even higher
is more attractive than this...‬

36
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:05,239
‫Okay, with the same pleasures that you get from these...
Okay, okay, I said it.‬

37
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:13,079
‫If I want to give you many examples of open source systems,
Linux and BSD, and some...‬

38
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:19,239
‫specific software, I can tell you Apache and Firefox.
Although Firefox has recently...‬

39
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:26,080
‫changed its policies, and there has been a big debate
about this, with people saying that...‬

40
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,840
‫it's moving away from open source due to
its financial needs regarding policy changes.‬

41
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,720
‫And Linux is everywhere. The biggest thing
that you are probably all using if you haven't had Linux on...‬

42
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:43,840
‫your device before is Android. Android's kernel
is completely Linux.‬

43
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,240
‫We've all had an Android phone in our pockets
at some point. We've all been Linux users in a way...‬

44
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,880
‫without knowing it.‬

45
00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:01,400
‫Linux, the Linux kernel alone is just a kernel and
cannot take you anywhere. This...‬

46
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,919
‫Linus Torvalds himself said this. The Linux kernel
started being built in...‬

47
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:15,960
‫1991. And why was it built? Linus Torvalds was looking
for a system that he could review the code for his university...‬

48
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:23,680
‫and edit or modify it in any way he wanted.‬

49
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,840
‫He wanted it himself, and such a thing didn't exist. And one
day he decided to start an operating system...‬

50
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:39,199
‫which is called Linux today. Linus Torvalds' initial idea
was a combination of the names "Freaks" and "Linux"...‬

51
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,440
‫was Linus, which would be Freaks and Unix.
Actually, Freaks. But what happened that it became Linux?‬

52
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:52,280
‫‫was renamed. One day, one of the FDP
Linux administrators named it after this system‬‬

53
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:58,080
‫‫operating system Linux, and Linus Torvalds liked
it and kept it. And the Linux mascot, which...‬‬

54
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,919
‫‫Probably Tux, you all know where this
came from? The Linux mascot, one day Linus Torvalds...‬‬

55
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:11,000
‫‫had gone to Australia and a penguin bit
him, and they made a meme out of it, and the mascot...‬‬

56
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,840
‫‫of Linux is from that penguin that bit
Linus Torvalds...‬‬

57
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:25,919
‫‫bit him. The Linux kernel is monolithic.
We have several types of kernels: one is microkernels...‬‬

58
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,880
‫‫are, one is monolithic ones. Linus Torvalds
himself said that his biggest...‬‬

59
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:38,919
‫‫mistake was writing Linux as monolithic. What
does monolithic do? It keeps...‬‬

60
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:47,199
‫‫memory management, drivers, and some other things
in the kernel space and shifts the rest...‬‬

61
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:53,400
‫‫all to user space, where drivers, file
systems are all on user...‬‬

62
00:06:53,400 --> 00:07:02,199
‫‫space which ride on the kernel space and
deliver the system to you. But microkernels...‬‬

63
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:10,759
‫‫are very minimal, only IPSs and low-level
memory management are in the kernel...‬‬

64
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:18,400
‫‫space, and the rest all have to ride on this
microkernel as separate packages.‬‬

65
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,120
‫‫Our Linux drivers, however, are in this form.
For example, you've probably seen that when...‬‬

66
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:31,120
‫‫you want a graphics card, your graphics card is new,
you have to install that specific driver, for example, N...‬‬

67
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,319
‫‫vidia or AMD to have full support,
otherwise it uses the graphics card...‬‬

68
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,120
‫‫of your motherboard which becomes very slow.
It has very poor rendering...‬‬

69
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:48,199
‫‫and ultimately provides you with bad performance.‬‬

70
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:56,280
‫‫And Linux supports a lot of hardware
and is far, far ahead of B...‬‬

71
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:03,599
‫‫SD in this regard. BSD primarily focuses
on boards, whereas Linux...‬‬

72
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,840
‫‫also gives a lot of importance to home computers and
always tries to quickly support many...‬‬

73
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:16,599
‫‫of these hardware pieces in this matter. Some distributions
like Fedora, like Arch, are called...‬‬

74
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:22,879
‫‫bleeding-edge, which provide the fastest updates.
Linus Torvalds' own distribution...‬‬

75
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:29,840
‫‫is Fedora, and the speed of supporting new
hardware in Linux is much...‬‬

76
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:37,039
‫‫higher. Win, in, is higher than BSD.
Debian and...‬‬

77
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:46,680
‫‫Ubuntu, please, an explanation, a few years ago
in Tehran, I think, I had, half, is it still active...‬‬

78
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:54,720
‫‫I don't know, I have no information. I don't
know what I'm doing that...‬‬

00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,480
‫‫Tehran.‬‬

80
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:07,480
‫‫There is a distribution that is also made in Iran.‬‬

81
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:14,320
‫‫Its name is Parch. It is based on Arch, by Mr. Sohrab.‬‬

82
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:21,040
‫‫They are developing it. There is also a distribution
that is very strange, its name is Predator, oh.‬‬

83
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:27,640
‫‫They came to mix, for example, Black Box and Kali.
To be very security-oriented, but the result...‬‬

84
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:34,399
‫‫is not interesting at all. But Parch, so far,
has been the most interesting of all. Another distribution that...‬‬

85
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,839
‫‫is very interesting and new that has come...
which is new, what can I say, it's based on Arch and...‬‬

86
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:49,040
‫‫it's very user-friendly. Its name is Manjaro.
Assume it's Ubuntu based on Arch.‬‬

87
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:58,320
‫‫And that level of access and drivers that Arch uses
it provides with a very high level of user-friendliness...‬‬

88
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,760
‫‫very, very high. Manjaro, Debian, and Ubuntu.
Debian is a kernel, a...‬‬

89
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,880
‫‫distribution that is very easy, reliable,
and many power users...‬‬

90
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:18,320
‫‫use it. Many servers that use Linux and
run Debian server...‬‬

91
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:26,079
‫‫runs. Ubuntu is based on Debian and is very user-friendly.
It's almost... it's about to become Windows...‬‬

92
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:32,040
‫‫it's so user-friendly and the community support that
as I said, is behind Linux, is higher than any...‬‬

93
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:38,920
‫‫open-source operating system you can think of.
And in Linux, something that exists is...‬‬

94
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,800
‫‫that no one owns Linux. Linus Torvalds is the
lead...‬‬

95
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:51,959
‫‫for the project, and there are some things he has
called Lieutenants or...‬‬

96
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:58,040
‫‫like Major, Colonel, something like that, who
manage the other developers on how...‬‬

97
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:04,519
‫‫which code merges should be done. Besides the
mainline kernel, we have LTS and...‬‬

98
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:11,519
‫‫we have. You probably know about them, we have
Mod Z which is very fast, based on Linux Zen which...‬‬

99
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:20,519
‫‫It also supports many up-to-date hard drives and
provides very high performance. And...‬‬

100

‫‫Hardened kernel, which is security-based and
tries to block many accesses to secure the system...‬‬

told you, Fedora is very...‬
‫was renamed. One day, one of the FDP
Linux administrators named it after this system‬‬

102
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:41,399
‫‫It supports all new technologies.
Bleeding edge. And Linus's personal distribution...‬‬

103
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:51,000
‫‫We have CentOS as an enterprise version
of Linux that isn't around much anymore.‬‬

104
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,440
‫‫Okay, we also have Red Hat which is very enterprise
and the community made a copy in a way that is‬‬

105
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:04,120
‫‫a complete copy of Red Hat, which became CentOS, and is offered for free.
And they try to, for example,‬‬

106
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:11,360
‫‫keep all of Red Hat's updates with a one-month delay. Red Hat is financially
supported by IBM,‬‬

107
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,079
‫‫but CentOS is entirely community-driven.‬‬

108
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:23,399
‫‫BSD! Probably many of you haven't heard of it.
BSD goes back to‬‬

109
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:27,160
‫‫Berkeley University, the place where Unix
was first‬‬

110
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:34,040
‫‫built, and Unix-like BSD also has
some distributions. This includes FreeBSD,‬‬

111
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,959
‫‫NetBSD, and OpenBSD. Everyone thinks
that large applications like‬‬

112
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:45,000
‫‫WhatsApp, like Netflix, use Linux for their servers, but they use BSD.‬‬

113
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,120
‫‫They also use FreeBSD. The main difference between Linux and BSDs
is that Linux is a kernel; without GNU,‬‬

114
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,760
‫‫it cannot do anything. If there were no
glibc, no core utilities, no compilers, no shell, Linux is just an empty kernel that only‬‬

115
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:02,160
‫‫manages hardware, it has memory management,
it has IP addresses, but BSD is provided to you as‬‬

116
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:09,360
‫‫a complete OS. And macOS is written based on BSD. The Darwin kernel‬‬

117
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:16,839
‫‫is entirely based on BSD. PlayStation 3 and 4
their operating system is based on BSD. Xbox‬‬

118
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:24,480
‫‫is based on BSD, and the focus of BSD
is to very much in a‬‬

119
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:31,199
‫‫minimal way support hardware, especially
boards.‬‬

120
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:39,279
‫‫As I told you, BSD's use case is for embedded systems, firewalls,‬‬

121
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:47,720
‫‫and what it specializes in is security.
Another major difference in the‬‬

122
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:55,399
‫‫security of Linux and BSD is that when Linux boots, it glues all the components
together in a fixed way in memory.‬‬

123
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:02,880
‫‫They have a specific place and are executed.‬‬

124
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:09,240
‫‫But when BSD boots, it glues these components together randomly, separately, each time.‬‬

125
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:15,519
‫‫That's why in almost over 40 years,
perhaps only 10 critical errors have been found in BSD,‬‬

126
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:21,759
‫‫but well, Linux has a much higher statistic.‬‬

127
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,360
‫‫You had Android, right? Asi, we said we'll bring and attach part by part.‬‬

128
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:34,560
‫‫This is modular, meaning for example, if there's an error in a part... Yes, it's modular, but...‬‬

129
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,880
‫‫Linux has a much greater focus on the modularity of the operating system compared to BSD.‬‬

130
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,560
‫‫As you...‬‬

131
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,959
‫‫see, BSD is much more minimal than even Linux, in terms of the kernel, that's why...‬‬

132
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:59,160
‫‫managing it is easier for them, because it provides the operating system as a whole unit...‬‬

133
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:07,320
‫‫It's monolithic, because of this, BSD is also...‬‬

134
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,759
‫‫monolithic. This is something that, for example, you know monolithic means you might not be able to, for example, want to change a part...‬‬

135
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:19,639
‫‫You might have to mess up the whole structure, right? Then this problem doesn't arise.‬‬

136
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:25,680
‫‫The fact that...
In what you're saying it's easier...‬‬

137
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,399

155
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:32,799

156
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:41,200
‫...cloud computing. It has a very fast boot time and runs on very weak systems...‬

157

159
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:57,679
‫Richard Stallman really emphasized that this is GNU/Linux.‬

160
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:06,039
‫So his effort wouldn't be wasted. But it wasn't about Wine. Wine came after.‬

161
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:10,960
‫After that. Yes, it was fast. In time... No.‬

162

166

171
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,520
‫...and BSD has its own special license, which is permissive.‬

172

‫...your computer. For some, the freedom of having everything from the kernel upwards...‬

177
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:54,880
‫...in their own hands is important. According to their taste, from their bootloader to their user manager to...‬

178
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:01,919
‫...the protocol that brings up their desktop, which X or Wayland makes this very complicated.‬

179
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:09,120
‫For this, you need to be a power user, and distributions like Arch... like, if you're even‬

180
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,960
‫much more advanced, you can use Linux From Scratch or Gentoo, where even‬

181
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,360
‫compiling your kernel is completely in your hands. It doesn't provide binaries. You have to build everything‬

182
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,880
‫from source on your own system. Of course, building from source...‬

183
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:30,200
‫...increases execution speed because the compiler performs some modifications on the code based on your hardware...‬

184
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:39,600
‫at the assembly level so it runs better on your system. Or‬

185
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:46,159
‫if user-friendliness is important to you, like distributions such as Ubuntu, Debian, Manjaro, Mint...‬

186
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:51,480
‫which are very easy, you might be able to use them even with very little knowledge. There's a distribution‬

187
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:58,400
‫called Zorin OS whose interface is entirely Windows-like, but in the background it runs the Linux kernel.‬

188
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,720
‫runs. And if security is important to you, well,‬

189
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:10,640
‫you can go for BSD distributions or some specific Linux distributions that‬

190
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,200
‫are made specifically for this purpose. Or if customization is important to you, you can use‬

191
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,799
‫a window manager. You don't even need to use a desktop environment like GNOME or like KDE.‬

192
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:28,919
‫You can use Wayland... the Wayland protocol and Hyprland.‬

193
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:36,400
‫use. 5 minutes, now that thing... RAM becomes‬

194
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,480
‫Let's bring up the next one, Wine.‬

195
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,679
‫the main point of this‬

196
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:54,279
‫Wine... Wine is a compatibility layer for Linux. What it does‬

197
00:21:54,279 --> 00:22:01,039
‫is that it brings up Windows API calls, system APIs, and system calls virtually in‬

198
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:06,840
‫Linux, and because of that, you can run Windows programs, DLLs, executables in Linux.‬

199
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:14,400
‫Wine has a site called WineHQ, where you can see the versions that Wine supports...‬

200
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:20,480
‫...supports, which you can install on Linux and use.‬

201
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,240
‫For example, a very simple example could be the Minesweeper game.‬

202
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,360
‫Okay.‬

203
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:38,360
‫...that even with the Wine debugger, you can at the assembly level trace all API calls between the...‬

204
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:47,440
‫...Windows executable code and Linux system calls, and even manipulate the code in memory...‬

205
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,360
‫...and it gives you complete freedom in this library.‬

206
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:58,480
‫You can dump your memory map, in...‬

207
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:06,320
‫...memory, change your clock, change your money. For crackers, if they are here, it can be very...‬

208
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,200
‫...interesting to see all the API calls and their exchanges.‬

209
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:19,039
‫And this can be a solution for you to...‬

210
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:24,880
‫...minimize your need for Windows, if there is a specific program that only runs on Windows...‬

211
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,200
‫...runs...‬

212
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:34,600
‫...on. Questions?‬

213
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:41,480
‫Please, there's a presentation theme...‬

214
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:51,880
‫...put a theme. This is actually the source [music]‬

215
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:57,760
‫The question isn't why open source programs are better?‬

216
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:04,760
‫Because everyone can see and edit the code. But in closed source, this code is in the hands of a few...‬

217
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:12,320
‫...limited individuals, and errors may occur that those limited individuals don't notice. But if...‬

218
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:19,120
‫...your code is available and everyone can see it every day, these modifications that are provided...‬

219
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:25,440
‫...may be in your code. You say, for example, we release our code, how can it not be bypassed?‬

220
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:32,520
‫If, for instance, there's a certain level of security, part of the core itself and a...‬

221
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:38,600
‫...program that is high-level, programs that are usually important are not open-sourced.‬

222
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:45,120
‫Like banking portals. They remain in the hands of a few specific people who are the only ones who...‬

223
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:51,600
‫...can modify them. The open-source programs that are usually provided...‬

224
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:59,000
‫...are programs that are used daily by everyone and do not have a specific impact on the database.‬

225
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:06,559
‫For example, I'll say banking portals again. If it becomes open source, if someone can find a little, one percent, a...‬

226
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:11,320
‫...bug in the middle, which they find anyway, although there's no need for this...‬

227
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:17,000
‫...this. They can gain critical access and it becomes very terrible. Not every program should...‬

228
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,760
‫...maybe become open source, but there are better open-source programs too.‬

229
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:29,919
‫Did you mean that, for example, it shouldn't have additional access...‬

230
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,200
‫...for users, so to speak, something like that? Programs that have functional access, or if...‬

231
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:42,399
‫...you open-source it, you shouldn't open-source that part. You should provide a level of openness,‬

232
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:49,640
‫...or you shouldn't open-source it at all, if it's very, very important, yes. But well, for example, even if...‬

233
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:55,840
‫...a software does this and now uses some other user information,‬

234
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:04,000
‫...well, it can just not open-source that part, right? Yes.‬

235
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:11,720
‫Even Android applications, when they compile them, they add an obfuscation layer...‬

236
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:20,760
‫...so that it cannot be bypassed, they cannot reverse engineer it and read the code and bypass it, right? And this...‬

237
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:26,679
‫...and this you said, there's an explanation that the kernel isn't an explanation, it's a layer, a...‬

238
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:35,159
‫...compatibility layer that comes and we can say it's a program through which Windows programs...‬

239
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:39,279
‫...can be run on Linux. Ah, thanks.‬

240
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:44,279
‫It was a misunderstanding on my part then.‬

241
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:53,300
‫It's finished. [Applause]‬
