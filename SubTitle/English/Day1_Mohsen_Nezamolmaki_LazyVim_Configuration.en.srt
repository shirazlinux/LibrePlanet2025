00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,880
‫Hello. Hello, hope you're not tired. Thank you for coming and dedicating your time.‬

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,440
‫dedicating your time and...‬

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,359
‫Yeah, just a...‬

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:30,759
‫My name is Mohsen Nezamolmolki, I'm a developer, and I'm here to introduce you to LazyVim editor. It's the editor that I use for my own development work.‬

7
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:36,440
‫I use it for all my editing work, both for system administration tasks and software development.‬

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:43,719
‫And before anything else, is there anyone here who has worked with Vim?‬

9
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:51,520
‫With Vim, maybe just for Git commits, Git commits?‬

10
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,440
‫So, nobody has worked with Vim. LazyVim is actually the same Vim but with some default‬

11
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,800
‫configurations that allow you to set up your Vim much faster‬

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,960
‫and start working with it. Vim is a well-known editor that is difficult to work with‬

13
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,680
‫on its own, but in return, it significantly increases speed and is usually not for beginners‬

14
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,079
‫and newcomers. And since there's no one here who has worked with Vim, I need to give you an‬

15
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:30,400
‫introduction about Vim. Vim is terminal-based and very configurable.‬

16
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:38,360
‫And its main point is that you...‬

17
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:44,040
‫meaning its main feature is that its entire focus is on the keyboard, and you can perform all‬

18
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:51,119
‫the actions you would do on an editor or IDE without taking your hands off the keyboard.‬

19
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,159
‫Perform them without using a mouse. This is suitable for people who work a lot with the keyboard.‬

20
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:01,719
‫suitable for people who work a lot with the keyboard.‬

21
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:04,600
‫But let's see in practice what this Vim‬

22
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,040
‫is. For example, I will open a file.‬

23
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,920
‫A file that I wrote before. It's a bash script. Okay, I have opened Vim now. This is the Vim environment.‬

24
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:24,920
‫By default, when you enter the Vim environment, you‬

25
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,480
‫cannot type anything.‬

26
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,440
‫cannot type‬

27
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,360
‫In...‬

28
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,280
‫For example, if you press the "j" key or the "Carro" key, you move between lines.‬

29
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:51,720
‫And if, for example, you press the "j" key twice, you go to the beginning of the line, or if you press Shift+g...‬

30
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,080
‫...you go to the end of the file. But you cannot type anything.‬

31
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,920
‫Because Vim is a modal editor, meaning it has different modes. When you open Vim,‬

32
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:10,560
‫you are in normal mode, meaning Vim's operators are active; meaning instead of‬

33
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,799
‫writing "j",‬

34
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,080
‫it moves one line down. Meaning...‬

35
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,920
‫...it comes down, with "k" it moves up. It navigates, so to speak.‬

36
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,680
‫And for example, if you want to go to the end of a line, you can use...‬

37
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:35,480
‫...the star key to go to the end of that line. If you paid attention to the cursor. But if...‬

38
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,680
‫...you want to type something in it, you must enter another mode called insert. And how do you...‬

39
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,040
‫...enter insert mode? You just need to press the "i" key. If I am on this line now...‬

40
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,120
‫...and press the "i" key,‬

41
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,439
‫it writes "INSERT" down here for me. Meaning I am now in insert mode, and now any key...‬

42
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:03,200
‫...I press on the keyboard will start typing. If I press Escape again...‬

43
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,480
‫...it exits insert mode. It no longer writes "INSERT" here and enters normal mode. And...‬

44
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:16,359
‫...now I can again move around in my code between lines, with letters; which are actually...‬

45
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:24,639
‫...my keyboard keys. Like j, k, and other keys where each key has an action.‬

46
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,440
‫...action. This means I don't have to take my hand off the keyboard. With the j key I can...‬

47
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,479
‫...go up and down without wanting to use the mouse, or without wanting to use the up...‬

48
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,199
‫...and down arrow keys.‬

49
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:50,080
‫Ah, yes, yes, good point.‬

50
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:02,240
‫Okay, but now I want to talk about LazyVim. This is just a simple editor and, well,‬

51
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,919
‫it has nothing. It doesn't have a file tree, nor does it give me errors if I write code in it. But...‬

52
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,560
‫‫...what I want to talk about now is an
editor like VS Code, which is...‬‬

53
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,000
‫‫actually based on Vim and runs in the terminal.‬‬

54
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:43,160
‫‫This editor is LazyVim. Now I'll start and
introduce its features.‬‬

55
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,199
‫‫The first feature I want to introduce is a file tree.
You don't have this by default in Vim, but well,‬‬

56
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,800
‫‫if you want to use it as an IDE, everyone
expects their IDE to have something like this, a file tree.‬‬

57
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,800
‫‫LazyVim gives you this by default.
Of course, I moved it to the right side.‬‬

58
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,880
‫‫Usually, file trees are on the left. The Vim editor
is very customizable, and I changed it, moved it to the right side‬‬

59
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:10,680
‫‫for myself.‬‬

60
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,840
‫‫Here, I can navigate in the file tree with the same Vim keys.‬‬

61
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,160
‫‫All of this is done with the keyboard, and you can see here
which key I'm pressing whenever I press a key.‬‬

62
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,400
‫‫I'll open a file. It also has an explorer here,
which if I click on it,‬‬

63
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,400
‫‫I can find the file name by searching,‬‬

64
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,440
‫‫like this. I'll open it again and find a file‬‬

65
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:45,319
‫‫in it.‬‬

66
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:48,240
‫‫Okay, we have a set of keybindings in the Vim editor
that we use for our tasks.‬‬

67
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,479
‫‫Since we practically don't use the mouse here,
most of our keybindings start with a specific key,‬‬

68
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:06,039
‫‫which is the space key here. For example, if I press
space twice, something like this opens up, and I can find the file‬‬

69
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:11,039
‫‫by typing its name. And now I'm in this file.‬‬

70
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:19,039
‫‫Okay, I opened the server.rs file, and it opened in a new tab for me.
I can switch between tabs with Alt+J or Alt+K.‬‬

71
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,960
‫‫Again, I'll open another file to make it three.‬‬

72
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:37,240
‫‫‬‬

73
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:48,319
‫‫I can move my tabs with Alt and Shift and,‬‬

74
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,440
‫‫for example, J. And if you saw, I moved this Cargo‬‬

75
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:57,199
‫‫to the first tab, I rearranged it.‬‬

76
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,400
‫‫Okay, keybindings: by default, Vim has some keybindings, which
you might...‬‬

77
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,840
‫‫when you use them, because of...
install it. But LazyVim has a good option...‬‬

78
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,759
‫‫When you press the space key, it shows you the keys, meaning
the keybindings, here.‬‬

79
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:28,000
‫‫It shows and guides you. If you have forgotten them,
you can remember them again.‬‬

80
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,440
‫‫For example, here, if I press space one more time,
it opens for finding files.‬‬

81
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,839
‫‫I can find my files. If I press B...‬‬

82
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,640
‫‫a new pop-up window opened again and tells me that
if I press Delete, for example, it will close this buffer or...‬‬

83
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,160
‫‫that tab for me. I'll press D now, and Cargo was closed. All...‬‬

84
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:59,880
‫‫of this is done with the keyboard.‬‬

85
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:06,360
‫‫I can split my windows with the key, with this key. Now we have two separate windows.‬‬

86
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,279
‫‫I can split this window again once more.‬‬

87
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,880
‫‫And now I have three windows, and I can now change the size of these with the mouse.‬‬

88
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,399
‫‫‬‬

89
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,680
‫‫Okay, let me close these extra windows.‬‬

90
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:34,800
‫‫‬‬

91
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,120
‫‫Okay, now let's talk about some features that we usually use in VS...‬‬

92
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:47,440
‫‫Code. Like, for example, commenting code, which we have all of this here. I can comment out a line of code with...‬‬

93
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,480
‫‫this keybinding. I can select and comment.‬‬

94
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,480
‫‫‬‬

95
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,240
‫‫Okay, our Vim editor is equipped with LSP. This means that in this file, where the function...‬‬

96
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,240
‫‫hello... I have features like Go to References, meaning the places...‬‬

97
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,240
‫‫where this function has been called, with the key combination GR.‬‬

98
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:26,320
‫‫It jumps into, well, Go to References to the references made to this function in...‬‬

99
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,640
‫‫‬‬

100
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:37,399
‫‫‬‬

101
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:43,680
‫‫‬‬

102
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,800
‫‫File. I have a good definition. I can jump to the
definition of this...‬‬

103
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,320
‫‫referenced function.‬‬

104
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,880
‫‫With this method, I can see the descriptions of functions or
types...‬‬

105
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:08,360
‫‫see. Here I see the type "Result", if I press Shift+K, I see its description. This description...‬‬

106
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,360
‫‫which is defined in the library, and I'm seeing it.‬‬

107
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,720
‫‫I can also have a global rename, meaning I can rename a function or a variable...‬‬

108
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,040
‫‫in a way that its name changes throughout the entire project.‬‬

109
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:39,079
‫‫Okay, for example, I'll change this "Seh Hello" to "Seh Goodbye".‬‬

110
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,720
‫‫Now, other places where this is called will also change...‬‬

111
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,560
‫‫it will change, wherever it's called.‬‬

112
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:01,440
‫‫Okay, for example, we see errors, we see warnings. In LazyVim, exactly...‬‬

113
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:08,000
‫‫as you expect and use in VS Code. Now I can see the full warning...‬‬

114
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,320
‫‫that is given here...‬‬

115
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,000
‫‫see. The warning given, for example, says that this import you've done is an unnecessary import.‬‬

116
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,360
‫‫It's unused. And we also have something called Code...‬‬

117
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,839
‫‫Action which can fix warnings and errors for us. Code Action, for example, is like this...‬‬

118
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,639
‫‫For instance, well, you should know its keybinding, but you can also use this popup...‬‬

119
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:44,240
‫‫use. You need to go to the "SP" section and if you click the first option, Code Action...‬‬

120
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,639
‫‫a series...‬‬

121
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,000
‫‫gives us a series of options for making some changes suitable for fixing that warning or...‬‬

122
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,800
‫‫error, to perform...‬‬

123
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:01,240
‫‫them. And if you look at the last one, it says "Remove unused import".‬‬

124
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:07,120
‫‫If I select this last one, it automatically removes the imports...‬‬

125
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,079
‫‫that are unused for me.‬‬

126
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:24,040
‫‫Anothe interesting thing is that when you are writing code and you haven't imported something...‬‬

127
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,360
‫‫you haven't, by using this same Code Action, it automatically adds the import for you...‬‬

128
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,360
‫‫does.‬‬

129
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:40,440
‫‫Let me talk about Git features in this editor. These colored parts of the code...‬‬

130
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,720
‫‫...mean they are new lines and haven't been committed yet.‬‬

131
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:53,920
‫‫Again, with key bindings, you can jump between these very quickly.‬‬

132
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:15,440
‫‫If you paid attention to the letters I typed, it was clear that with three words, with...‬‬

133
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,959
‫‫...three keys, meaning one key binding, I could switch between these.‬‬

134
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,320
‫‫I can stage it, this line of code...‬‬

135
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:39,480
‫‫...is now staged. This line and its color changed.‬‬

136
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,639
‫‫Just this line, I just staged this line. If, for example, you change two parts in a file...‬‬

137
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,800
‫‫...only that part is now staged.‬‬

138
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:57,759
‫‫I only staged this part of the line, not the whole file. The whole file...‬‬

139
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:02,920
‫‫...can be staged, if you want.‬‬

140
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:09,040
‫‫Now, to have, in fact, full access to everything that Git wants, the task that...‬‬

141
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,360
‫‫...you want to do with Git, it has a Git editor inside itself.‬‬

142
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,680
‫‫which opens like this.‬‬

143
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:26,000
‫‫And on the left side are the files, and the right side...‬‬

144
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,600
‫‫...shows the content of the file, it actually shows their diff, and now here you can...‬‬

145
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,560
‫‫...stage any file you want. For example, I can now stage the client.‬‬

146
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,759
‫‫All of it. Again, the Git Blame...‬‬

147
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,800
‫‫...we have. If I now press Git Blame, maybe it's not very, very clear, but this is a...‬‬

148
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,759
‫‫...popup and there it says, for example, who made this commit and what the commit name...‬‬

149
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,720
‫‫...was and what its diff was.‬‬

150
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:20,160
‫‫Let me just say, this Git feature you're showing, is it LazyGit or LeGit? No, it was LazyGit...‬‬

151
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,759
‫‫...itself, yes.‬‬

152
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,000
‫‫I myself use LazyGit separately, I don't open it within it, it's easier this way. But if...‬‬

153
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,240
‫‫If you install LazyGit, it has LazyGit too, right?
You need to install LazyGit for this to show up as well.‬‬

154
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:41,480
‫‫You really need to install it.
There's not much time left for installing it anyway.‬‬

155
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,800
‫‫I won't enter its website, you can go and check it out.
But its configuration...‬‬

156
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:56,160
‫‫in the file, in the configuration path
of Neovim.‬‬

157
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:11,160
‫‫Here, here the configurations are in this section.
In the configuration, there are general configurations, key...‬‬

158
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,760
‫‫You can define the keymaps here, if you want
to change them, just as I just did...‬‬

159
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:23,559
‫‫and the options for general editor changes, for example, a white theme...‬‬

160
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:30,760
‫‫or for instance, how much spacing tabs should have
and now some other options that well...‬‬

161
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,280
‫‫mostly Vim users are familiar with.‬‬

162
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,640
‫‫And also in the plugins, configurations that
are related to plugins that are added separately...‬‬

163
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:49,280
‫‫to Vim. And LazyVim itself already had some
plugins, and you need to...‬‬

164
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:57,720
‫‫change them here. For example, I open this file.
Each of these is a plugin...‬‬

165
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:05,080
‫‫and for instance, if I want to change this, under
the title, well, this file is Lua, but also very...‬‬

166
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:11,240
‫‫well, similar, somewhat similar to JSON as
well. Now it gets configured here.‬‬

167
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,440
‫‫Now, you should go and study more about it yourself,
because it's also very time-consuming.‬‬

168
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,640
‫‫There's also not much time left for me to explain
more...‬‬

169
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:36,190
‫‫give. That's it. Thank you.
