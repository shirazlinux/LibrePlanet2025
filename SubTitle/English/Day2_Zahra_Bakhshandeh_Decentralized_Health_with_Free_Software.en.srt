‫[Music]
Hello and good time everyone‬

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:16,800
‫I am Zahra Bakhshandeh and I know
almost many of the children who are here.‬

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,119
‫Familiar faces! I'm very happy to be with you
at this conference today and I hope that...‬

6
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:30,039
‫the content presented will be useful for you.
As the title of my presentation indicates,‬

7
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:37,239
‫we are going to talk about the discussion related to decentralized
and free software in the healthcare space.‬

8
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:45,440
‫A topic that has a lot of potential for improvement
and is very critical, yet in many...‬

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,440
‫places it has been left out in technology.‬

10
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,879
‫Well, I'll start my slides with an introduction
to talk about the shortcomings of technology in the world of healthcare.‬

11
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:03,640
‫After that, we'll go to free software
and also decentralized storage of health and medical data.‬

12
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:11,119
‫And finally, we'll take a look at
the future that the world of healthcare can have considering...‬

13
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:17,799
‫free software as well as decentralized
data.‬

14
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:24,360
‫Well, first of all, let's go to the shortcomings
that exist. The discussion of health and medicine is one of the...‬

15
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:33,399
‫completely critical discussions for all communities
around the world. However, in terms of technology...‬

16
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:40,720
‫it has a lot of challenges. One of them
is that most of the software in this field...‬

17
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,840
‫is under the supervision of specific companies
and has more of a commercial view towards them. Well, now...‬

18
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:53,079
‫What is wrong with this? It is quite clear that
when we do not have access to the code of a software,...‬

19
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:59,520
‫we are not aware of its flaws. The flaw might
be related to security. This is also problematic, meaning...‬

20
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,680
‫there is no transparency whatsoever. The issue of security
is also likely to face problems. But, in addition to these...‬

21
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,319
‫since it is under the supervision of a company, naturally,
only a specific group works on it.‬

22
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:17,800
‫And this causes our problem, which is
improving that software, to be limited. And...‬

23
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:24,720
‫many of the existing ideas cannot be implemented
on them. And this actually...‬

24
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:32,360
‫becomes problematic, for what? For the discussion
of global medical improvement. But the second...‬

25
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,400
‫point that exists...‬

26
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:48,400
‫point that exists‬

27
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,400
‫exists‬

28
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:59,319
‫exists. Well, friends, our discussion was about the challenges
that exist in the field of healthcare. The first‬

29
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:05,319
‫point was that most of the software
that exists is not free‬

30
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:11,480
‫and is under the supervision of different companies, but
the second point that exists and which many‬

31
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:18,519
‫can say is a challenge is that data storage
is completely centralized. What does that mean? It means‬

32
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:24,599
‫that if an organization has a software
and receives some data from patients,‬

33
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:32,159
‫it stores that data on its own server, and if a second organization
also exists, it also has its own system,‬

34
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,640
‫meaning that the concept of data
integration simply does not exist here. A simple example, if we want to say, let's assume that‬

35
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,120
‫in the field of healthcare, someone goes and gets a test
done at a laboratory, which is a routine thing‬

36
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:50,519
‫that always exists. Well, now if they want to visit
a cardiologist,‬

37
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,959
‫they have to manually bring the data
obtained from that laboratory and submit it,‬

38
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:01,360
‫meaning there is often no connection
between doctors, clinics, and hospitals,‬

39
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,760
‫and the reason for this is that data is stored in a centralized manner.
Well, now we are going to‬

40
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:14,159
‫talk about what happens if we take healthcare towards
free software. What happens if we go‬

41
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:20,959
‫towards decentralization? And have any efforts been made so far or not? First‬

42
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,199
‫of all, let's assume that we take the discussion of healthcare
towards using free software. Well, what happens here?‬

43
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:35,479
‫The first thing that is clear is that
since the code exists, there is more trust‬

44
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:42,360
‫and better transparency for patients
to use different software, but the key point‬

45
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,280
‫is that we separate ownership from the discussion
of healthcare on different software. Well, what does this lead to? This leads to‬

46
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:55,160
‫the software that exists, instead of being
simply under the supervision of one company, a team from‬

47
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,720
‫all over the world can work on it, implement
different ideas on it, and well, this‬

48
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,440
‫allows us to have a very good global
improvement in the field of healthcare [__].‬

49
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:12,520
‫And the main point that exists is that healthcare
is essential for everywhere in the world. We do something‬

50
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:18,120
‫so that we can have a very good global
improvement in the field of healthcare [__].‬

51
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:24,680
‫And the main point that exists is that healthcare
is essential for everywhere in the world. We do something‬

52
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:32,120
‫so that we don't improve the scaling solely on a specific area and instead improve it‬

53
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:42,400
‫in a completely global manner. But with these explanations, is the project actually open source software?‬

54
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:50,560
‫or not? Unfortunately, despite this topic being very important and fundamental and potentially very helpful,‬

55
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,759
‫due to commercial considerations and a certain perspective they currently have on projects, the security they aim for,‬

56
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:04,400
‫from the perspective they currently have on projects, the security they aim for,‬

57
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,759
‫the topic of open source software in healthcare hasn't‬

58
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:16,759
‫become widespread enough. However, there are some projects. One of the most well-known is the‬

59
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:24,960
‫GNU Health project. This project was launched in 2010 and is actually used for managing digital records‬

60
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,759
‫of patients. The space it provides is for working with hospitals and‬

61
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:36,280
‫different clinics. Because it allows them to share their data with each other‬

62
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:42,800
‫as well. Furthermore, the vision it has, the goals it actually has,‬

63
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:50,160
‫are beyond this. It deals with various epidemics like Corona, Influenza, and collects data,‬

64
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:57,800
‫stores it, and through that, it can have statistical and analytical insights.‬

65
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:06,080
‫Besides these cases, it is also active in the area of social health [__], and its goal is‬

66
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,160
‫to be able to provide positive points in the fields of poverty and nutrition, especially in countries that are not‬

67
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,520
‫developed. It is currently being used in different places‬

68
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:26,199
‫and is among the projects in the open world that have been able to get a good output‬

69
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:31,720
‫from it. But another project that exists, which was launched in the year‬

70
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:42,720
‫2011, is Orthanc. This project is actually a server. A server that allows‬

71
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,680
‫first of all, it's very light, very easy to work with, and it allows‬

72
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,520
‫different organizations working in the medical field‬

73
00:07:52,520 --> 00:08:00,479
‫to install this server, and those devices related to medical images,‬

74
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,919
‫like CT scans, like MRI, they can easily connect these to it‬

75
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:12,599
‫and thus manage their image data, and‬

76
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:19,280
‫it also uses the format for medical images and has no problem with it.‬

77
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:25,960
‫it. A good point it has is that its installation is extremely simple. It's cross-platform, meaning it runs easily on‬

78
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:34,039
‫Windows, Mac, and Linux. It doesn't need very specific hardware.‬

79
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:39,399
‫To the extent that it can be run on very simple single-board computers (like Raspberry Pi?), and one point that‬

80
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:44,279
‫exists is that it allows us to have REST APIs from the data we have, which makes working with it‬

81
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:49,800
‫very easy for us. This project also currently exists and‬

82
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:57,839
‫is being used. Well, so far we've talked about using open-source software‬

83
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:04,800
‫in the world of healthcare, but one point that exists is that the healthcare world is very full‬

84
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,120
‫of various challenges. Meaning when you enter it, even with a small project, you easily‬

85
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:16,000
‫see these challenges, for example, from different‬

86
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,959
‫organizations there are certain challenges, and also from the different data that is stored,‬

87
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:30,279
‫the issue of that data's security. So it can be said that in this world, what needs to be done‬

88
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:36,120
‫should be a bit beyond open-source software, a bit deeper. What does that mean? It means we need to‬

89
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:44,240
‫go towards using open architectures that exist for decentralizing data.‬

90
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:51,560
‫What does that mean? In the discussion of centralization, we said that the data of each organization, each software, is‬

91
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:57,640
‫running on its own dedicated server, and this causes us to not have the discussion related to data uniformity.‬

92
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:05,000
‫We don't have data uniformity, and another important point here is that the user does not own their data‬

93
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,519
‫in the context of centralization. Why? When I go and get a test, that test is being‬

94
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:16,519
‫stored as data on the server of an organization, and the ownership of that data and‬

95
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:23,920
‫its validity goes to that organization, not me, the user. The discussion of decentralization specifically arose to solve this very‬

96
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,480
‫problem, and open architectures like blockchain can also be used in this area.‬

97
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,360
‫used. In this world, it says let's consider a network where users‬

98
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,200
‫can store their data. In fact, different patients. This data should be completely‬

99
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,480
‫integrated. Meaning if I visit a cardiologist, all the tests and events‬

100
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,959
‫that have happened should be stored there. If I have a simple test, like a blood test, it should also be stored there again.‬

101
00:10:52,959 --> 00:11:00,600
‫be stored there. Furthermore, it allows that user, that patient, to have access.‬

102
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:08,959
‫‫can share their data with different people. This means the data ownership completely falls into the user's hands. This‬‬

103
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:16,320
‫‫What does that mean? It means I know that if I have a test, exactly who is seeing this test?‬‬

104
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,360
‫‫Something that doesn't exist right now is the discussion of our medical data. It's not clear‬‬

105
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:29,959
‫‫where it goes from where and what happens to it. If we want to explain this topic very simply,‬‬

106
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:36,320
‫‫how it is and how this happens, let's assume there is a network,‬‬

107
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,480
‫‫for example, a blockchain network. Different patients and...‬‬

108
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:50,120
‫‫Let's consider doctors as nodes in this network, and now doctors as specialists and‬‬

109
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,959
‫‫other users as different patients who exist. Everyone who is here,‬‬

110
00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:01,519
‫‫meaning both those who are specialists and those who are patients, should have a data wallet.‬‬

111
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:07,160
‫‫Something that currently exists on the blockchain in different projects is having a data wallet,‬‬

112
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:14,079
‫‫so that through this, they can store all their medical data in one place. This‬‬

113
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:20,480
‫‫What does this mean? If we consider from birth, from those initial tests that were done for us,‬‬

114
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:28,000
‫‫up to the rest of the journey, we have all of it completely. Often in the medical field,‬‬

115
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,639
‫‫what are the problems that arise? It's that we don't know if this event that just happened‬‬

116
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:39,639
‫‫has roots in childhood or not. Why? Because we don't have most of the data. Now, this data wallet of ours‬‬

117
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:45,600
‫‫comes completely securely and stores all this data. It's on the blockchain platform, so it's completely‬‬

118
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:54,120
‫‫encrypted, and this data is only visible to the patient themselves, not anyone else. Well now,‬‬

119
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,320
‫‫in this space, this space that now exists, it's not just for storing data.‬‬

120
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:06,120
‫‫It's also supposed to facilitate communication between specialists and patients. For example, I can get a‬‬

121
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:12,800
‫‫diet plan here, or I can get a report from a cardiologist. Well, since everything is‬‬

122
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,079
‫‫safe and secure, what happens? I can't do this anymore, because‬‬

123
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:23,480
‫‫except for myself, no one else had permission to see this data. In this state, we can‬‬

124
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:32,800
‫‫consider a method where the person can specifically open only the part of their data that is intended‬‬

125
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:40,040
‫‫for a specific specialist. Just a part of their data that is intended. For example, I‬‬

126
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:46,880
‫‫have all my medical data from birth. Now I have started a diet and‬‬

127
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,040
‫‫the person who wants to give me a diet said that they want my blood pressure, for example. Well, I‬‬

128
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,680
‫‫go into my data and look at all the tests related to my blood pressure at different stages of my life...‬‬

129
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:03,920
‫‫I unlock only that part and send it.‬‬

130
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,720
‫‫to that nutritionist. Well, what happened here is that it specifies who the data should go to.‬‬

131
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:16,680
‫‫Or what data. Now, here he has sent his blood sugar, and we can even say...‬‬

132
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:22,320
‫‫for how long. Meaning, for how long can this specific nutritionist have access to my data.‬‬

133
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,680
‫‫and this way, besides security, the issue of data control also completely falls into the patient's hands. This is something that is clearly the fundamental right of a user who is active in a healthcare system,‬‬

134
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:36,680
‫‫completely falls into the patient's hands. This is something that is clearly the fundamental right of a user who is active in a healthcare system,‬‬

135
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:44,079
‫‫is active in a healthcare system. And something that doesn't exist at all currently. Well, now let's see...‬‬

136
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:49,839
‫‫if this is beneficial for us or not? Moving towards being decentralized...‬‬

137
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,759
‫‫Naturally, from what I've said, you should now understand‬‬

138
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:03,199
‫‫the benefit it has. The first benefit it has, which is actually the most important one, is the issue of managing data ownership and...‬‬

139
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:09,800
‫‫now, controlling it is completely in the patient's hands. And this is the key point that should be here.‬‬

140
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:15,399
‫‫The next issue is security. Since...‬‬

141
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:22,800
‫‫the data is encrypted, the data that is stored is completely secure. And the next issue‬‬

142
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:31,000
‫‫is that communication between different people in that network is also established.‬‬

143
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,360
‫‫is in that network, the possibility of choosing data also happens where the user wants it to. And...‬‬

144
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:44,319
‫‫Another point is that everything is transparent and clear for one person, as a patient.‬‬

145
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:51,880
‫‫They can completely track who has been able to see their data and in what time frame. But let's go to projects that are open-source software...‬‬

146
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:58,880
‫‫see it. But let's go to projects that are open-source software...‬‬

147
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,040
‫‫and decentralized, which exist now.‬‬

148
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,959
‫‫Unfortunately, in this field, the number of projects that exist is much fewer than...‬‬

149
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:13,959
‫‫projects that are simply centralized and open-source software. However,‬‬

150
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:20,040
‫‫Despite this, I have brought two examples here. The first case is MedChain. This is a...‬‬

151
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:27,279
‫‫relatively small project that a group of students developed. It came up in 2022.‬‬

152
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:34,440
‫It hasn't reached the production stage yet, but it has an interesting method.‬

153
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:40,959
‫Its method is that we have a set of doctors, and now a set of patients want to visit those doctors.‬

154
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:47,000
‫Instead of storing their information in a database, they come and store it on the blockchain platform,‬

155
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
‫meaning the platform it uses for decentralization is the blockchain.‬

156
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,600
‫Okay, what happens is that the doctor in question comes and logs in.‬

157
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:07,400
‫To what? To the wallet they have, which is usually MetaMask. After they come and‬

158
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:15,120
‫are logged in, they get the public address of that specific user, that specific patient, and once they‬

159
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:21,520
‫receive it, what they do is store that specific test or that specific feedback for that‬

160
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:29,760
‫specific patient on their own wallet, and for storing it, it's stored on IPFS,‬

161
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:36,280
‫which provides a secure space so that it can, both in terms of not burdening the blockchain platform,‬

162
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:42,320
‫and in terms of being able to manage these data securely, store them.‬

163
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,880
‫This way, all the data the user receives from different doctors are stored on their wallet‬

164
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,000
‫and they can access them.‬

165
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:01,240
‫And for the things used in it, like React and Solidity for‬

166
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:10,440
‫smart contracts, and Ethereum and IPFS, which I mentioned for data storage, are used.‬

167
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,480
‫But this project that existed, we said it is currently, meaning it hasn't reached the production stage yet,‬

168
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:24,240
‫only its code is on GitHub and it's a relatively small project. But another project‬

169
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:32,159
‫that exists is the topic of HIA of One. The 'One' at the end refers to the idea of‬

170
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:37,720
‫individual, or personalized. What kind of project is this? This is a‬

171
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:44,520
‫relatively larger project. It was presented in 2017, it's decentralized and open‬

172
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:53,280
‫source as well, but it has some points that we will talk about. This project actually‬

173
00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:01,600
‫manages user data exactly like the example I explained here,‬

174
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:08,080
‫meaning it comes and stores user data inside wallets. And what happens is‬

175
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:14,799
‫what? At different times, it only allows, with this structure (Who, What),‬

176
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:21,799
‫to be able to share our data between different doctors, meaning between different experts.‬

177
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:29,280
‫The structure it has is exactly this example, but based on the explanation I gave, some of its points are:‬

178
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:37,200
‫The main point is that this project is not on the blockchain platform, meaning it has used...‬

179
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:43,640
‫some other methods for its decentralization, but...‬

180
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:49,240
‫it's not necessarily on the blockchain platform. So, generally speaking...‬

181
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:56,200
‫At any scale, combining decentralization, even though currently on...‬

182
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:02,120
‫various articles are working on this topic and it's also present in different projects, still...‬

183
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:09,840
‫a project that is both free software and decentralized, and can be...‬

184
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:16,520
‫used, to that extent, doesn't exist, while there is a very high potential for this field.‬

185
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,880
‫exists. And if we want to take a look at the future that can happen for healthcare [__]...‬

186
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:27,480
‫well, if the existing method continues in this way, well, the challenges will increase every day.‬

187
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:34,000
‫more and more. But if we move healthcare towards free software and also...‬

188
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,039
‫towards decentralization, based on the free architectures that exist, there are positive points...‬

189
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:46,080
‫in this regard, as there is a very high potential in this field, and to the extent that...‬

190
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,360
‫even very small projects can be started in this field and advanced...‬

191
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:59,400
‫to monitor a part of this healthcare world. If we move projects...‬

192
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:06,280
‫in this direction, what happens is we reach a world of healthcare, a place where all patients...‬

193
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:12,440
‫have ownership of their own data. In addition, security is paramount for patients...‬

194
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:19,000
‫Doctors can communicate with each other, patients with each other easily and securely...‬

195
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,279
‫is completely possible. And that community is created which is growing and can globally...‬

196
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:32,559
‫expand this space. Some projects are currently working on these...‬

197
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,600
‫matters. All four items that I talked about...‬

198
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:44,360
‫as free software, I have provided their GitHub links and websites here...‬

199
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:50,919
‫so that if you want information, you can find and use it. I hope the content was useful...‬

200
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:56,200
‫for you. If you have any questions, please ask.‬

201
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,640
‫Please, do you have a question?‬

202
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,840
‫I'll put this file. Yes, I'll put the file.
You...‬

203
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:20,080
‫The question you asked was if it's a usable software
for end-users like doctors and their patients who use it.‬

204
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:28,440
‫They do. Its main goal is public health,
meaning as an end-user, doctors can also...‬

205
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:36,000
‫use it, this is one of its goals, but the main
goal that this project focuses on is the...‬

206
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,679
‫connection between clinics and...‬

207
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:46,480
‫hospitals.
Mostly, yes, exactly. And that second tool that...‬

208
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,360
‫existed, its installation is very simple, and it
can be used by various doctors who work in the field of...‬

209
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:59,919
‫images.
Another question, it was about the blockchain service, I don't
remember.‬

210
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,159
‫That's very good, Reza, this file between doctor
and patient and now... they need a transaction...‬

211
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:14,240
‫Exactly, cost? No, not a financial transaction, no, block-
chain is purely... Now, the project I'm working on myself, this example...‬

212
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,000
‫is. Blockchain is not solely for financial transactions.
It's for when a group of people as nodes...‬

213
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:27,480
‫are added to a space, to a network,
and in that existing network...‬

214
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,640
‫that trust needs to be formed, right? So
it's purely for this, now that transaction that...‬

215
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:39,880
‫happens, something that is usually in
our minds, well, it's the financial aspect that exists...‬

216
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:46,320
‫exists, but here, the transaction that
happens becomes about data transfer, about...‬

217
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:52,679
‫receiving feedback from the doctor and...‬

218
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:56,760
‫so on. Okay, no questions?
Please ask.‬

219
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:04,640
‫Many organizations...‬

220
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,760
‫fake work...‬

221
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,919
‫do that come...‬

222
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:18,080
‫Many times an organization wants to
train an AI model on its patients' data.‬

223
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,320
‫With what you said, this work practically
becomes impossible, I forgot to mention this.‬

224
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:30,200
‫Thank you very much for mentioning it. One of the
most fundamental... Now, because I myself worked on this project...‬

225
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:35,480
‫worked, meaning the main details it has, something
I missed...‬

226
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:43,200
‫is the topic related to AI. Well, these projects
that are now coming up in the field of healthcare, one goal...‬

227
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:50,679
‫they have is to be able to improve the topic related
to healthcare from several aspects? In terms of... Well, they are...‬

228
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:56,559
‫already storing data from birth.
They should be able to detect from a certain point onwards if...‬

229
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,880
‫a certain specific disease will occur or not.
Meaning they can do prediction and in some places, prevention.‬

230
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,919
‫Why? Despite having very strong models now
in other fields.‬

231
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,880
‫In the field of healthcare, this is not the case.
This is the biggest challenge for people.‬

232
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:20,399
‫What happens here? We have a network where different
people have wallets. Well, that wallet that exists...‬

233
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:26,919
‫is completely secure, meaning no one can see that
data. So, consequently, according to our view...‬

234
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:32,000
‫AI models cannot use it.
Why? Because in reality, the data is encrypted.‬

235
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,120
‫But a new AI has emerged, the topic of federated learning.
It doesn't need the data.‬

236
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:45,320
‫What it actually does, it doesn't ask for the data
from me, the programmer. It works on the encrypted data.‬

237
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:52,240
‫And now it returns those weights and that final output
to us.‬

238
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:59,559
‫So in this space that exists, there is a very large
volume of data, all of which is like a...‬

239
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:07,440
‫single fabric/piece stored. Now suppose we implement
federated learning on such a network...‬

240
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,240
‫we can get better results than taking a limited
amount of data...‬

241
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:18,600
‫from a hospital. The same data they give, they usually apply many modifications to it...‬

242
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:24,120
‫so that the security of patients is not questioned. And
they usually give us a part of the data...‬

243
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:29,720
‫which cannot yield good results.
Meaning AI comes to work on the data...‬

244
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,600
‫that is encrypted, yes, to be trained. Yes, yes.
Without the programmer understanding anything...‬

245
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,640
‫So it returns the output to the programmer.
Interesting.‬

246
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,760
‫Then it's anonymous. Meaning the idea that
people's identity won't be revealed, right? No, revealed...‬

247
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:51,159
‫won't be. Okay, no more questions?‬

248
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:59,960
‫Go ahead. It's in their hands for a limited time, yes.
They can...‬

249
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:05,360
‫specify the time.
Data can be taken from birth...‬

250
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:11,679
‫up until now, until their current age. Then when you go
to the doctor, until that moment, for example, for a...‬

251
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,399
‫limited time it's in their hands. Then whenever you
don't want it anymore, they cancel it, yes. And...‬

252
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:21,840
‫‫Everything goes back to the individual
person again. The information is completely there. One of...‬‬

253
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:27,640
‫‫the features that can be considered is how
long that expert, meaning our expert here is the doctor,‬‬

254
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:32,039
‫‫should have access to the information?‬‬

255
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,799
‫‫Okay, any other questions?‬‬

256
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,840
‫‫Excuse me, why can't this data be stored
on the web? Is it because of potential data leaks?‬‬

257
00:27:52,840 --> 00:28:01,480
‫‫That's right. Currently, Cloudflare has added
a new feature that prevents AI from infiltrating websites.‬‬

258
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:07,640
‫‫Is this sufficient? Can we use it? No,
it's really not...‬‬

259
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:13,240
‫‫data is stored there, well. But here,
hash data... data is stored. Meaning everything is completely...‬‬

260
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:18,799
‫‫encrypted and stored with it... now, with
the various methods that exist, it's very...‬‬

261
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:24,880
‫‫different. Since only the hash data is stored
and now there are some...‬‬

262
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,159
‫‫methods. For example, Zero Knowledge exists,
MPC exists. If we check these...‬‬

263
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,960
‫‫now, we see that they are being used for this
very data storage.‬‬

264
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:41,799
‫‫For data encryption, actually for encrypting
and decrypting it, where the data itself is not...‬‬

265
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:48,240
‫‫stored at all. Meaning even when my data reaches
the expert, the expert again...‬‬

266
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,519
‫‫has to decrypt it, which itself has different
algorithms there.‬‬

267
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:58,919
‫‫So, the reason it's stored on the web is
because of its security, right? Yes, it's because of its security and...‬‬

268
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:07,240
‫‫that, well, it accepts a specific set, right?
This is going to be much larger.‬‬

269
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:25,720
‫‫Go ahead. Go ahead, yes, yes, yes. The point was that
there is a...‬‬

270
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:31,720
‫‫environment for medical students. As far as
I know, the information is called Sermo, I think.‬‬

271
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:37,200
‫‫There is an environment where doctors from
all over the world come and share their information. Meaning...‬‬

272
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,919
‫‫even give you a prescription there. You
can get a prescription there. In my opinion, even from...‬‬

273
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:50,480
‫‫that environment can be used for better diagnoses,
right? Yes, these cases exist and...‬‬

274
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,919
‫‫their number is not limited, but the problem is
that even those are limited. Meaning now they seem large...‬‬

275
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:02,840
‫‫but when we get into it, we see that it might
not even include one percent of the world's population.‬‬

276
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:08,360
‫‫Meaning that information is not... not publicly
available at all. Yes, not... not publicly...‬‬

277
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:14,360
‫‫available at all. Yes, available to them. Generally,
the availability of medical data for programmers is also...‬‬

278
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,880
‫‫always a challenge and difficult. Meaning
from that side they don't give us data and from this side if we don't have data‬‬

279
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:25,039
‫‫we can... if we don't have data we can't
do things... Thank you, be well.‬‬
