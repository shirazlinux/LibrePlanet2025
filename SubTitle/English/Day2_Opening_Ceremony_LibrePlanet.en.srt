00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:13,519
‫Alright kids, hello again. Temperature and weather,
is everything okay?‬

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:20,519
‫You who are on that side, do you see if those on the other side are okay too?
It's the second day of the conference.‬

5
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:25,840
‫LibrePlanet. If I want to briefly compare with yesterday, well, there were some weaknesses.‬

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,199
‫Mostly regarding the venue. So far, from our side as well, well, some‬

7
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,719
‫issues existed, but well, we tried to be able to fix them today. We promised that these‬

8
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:42,640
‫would be clarified, but well, they turned off their phones on us and don't answer. Which now, these...‬

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,680
‫I apologize to you. The next point is, we have received a video from FSF.‬

10
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,960
‫But subtitling it...
Doing the translation has become time-consuming. I‬

11
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:02,920
‫have the translation, but if I put the English video, well, I don't think the entire group‬

12
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:09,320
‫will be fully proficient, and it's a bit troublesome for the other kids. Yes, we'll try to put it on the channel tonight or tomorrow with‬

13
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,439
‫Farsi subtitles on the channel.
What does it have in English subtitles? English subtitles?‬

14
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:20,479
‫It doesn't have. We got the English subtitles, translated them, but we haven't been able to do the other tasks yet,‬

15
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:28,720
‫and we'll put this on the channel. And the next point, FSF itself has a form that‬

16
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,119
‫I'll put the link in the channel now as well.
You can also scan the QR code so that we‬

17
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,600
‫should come into the form. When you click it, now this is localized to Farsi. Where it's by‬

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:47,079
‫default English, make sure to select the country Iran, which in Iran is Shiraz, meaning right here‬

19
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:53,520
‫where we've set it up, and leave your comments there, which now are mostly about‬

20
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:01,560
‫local liberal and it asks you a few questions. How was your experience with Reza‬

21
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:08,679
‫and so on. It also has another page.
Ah, where it mostly says how‬

22
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:12,360
‫you got to know us. And Mohammad, my image is completely...‬

23
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:20,280
‫here. God's power! You paid attention for once, okay?
And it asks you about the survey this way. More completely,‬

24
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,800
‫the questions here are in Farsi. We'll put this too so you can fill it out there. Okay. The thing is,‬

25
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,760
‫I don't think there will be a problem if the kids write in Farsi.‬

26
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,640
‫Now you can use ChatGPT. Yes, I suggest you write in Farsi, give it to this to become English.‬

27
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:46,200
‫Give your feedback, it's better. Because it's the first year it's held in Iran, and our collaboration is supposed to continue‬

28
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,760
‫with FSF, not just in LibrePlanet. We're going to run a few operational campaigns.‬

29
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,959
‫run. Of course, I think "operation translate" is wrong. Everyone thinks of operations‬

30
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:04,200
‫like suicide attacks and stuff. Yes, but the intention is the same campaign and promotion of free software culture, in this‬

31
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,560
‫way. We also have another video, meaning yesterday‬

32
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:15,680
‫that the kids dubbed, I'll put it for you to watch. It's a very cool video, the kids‬

33
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,400
‫liked it. I'll play the video, then we'll go to Mohammad's first presentation‬

34
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,720
‫Shojaei's, also about artificial intelligence.‬

35
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,159

38
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,879
‫I think we should watch this. Hackers found our work. I found a problem in your proprietary‬

‫system that allows unauthorized remote control via Bluetooth.‬

40
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,519
‫Your vehicles are unsafe. No, my team has created free software that blocks Bluetooth‬

‫We're releasing this in 24 hours.
Everyone get out. Hey, I have something for you.‬

43
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,039
‫I'm running the final test. I'm uploading it from the lab internet. It will be about half‬

44
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:38,880
‫an hour until you receive it.‬

‫[Music]
Honestly, you won't believe what happened. What‬

46
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,280
‫happened? A motorcycle hit me, I fell down, in an ambulance.‬

47
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,560
‫One of the new self-driving models. On the way to the hospital. Someone took control of the ambulance.‬

48
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,000
‫I have your location. Whoever is doing this must be near you. That same motorcycle‬

00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,840
