00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:19,199
‫‫which is also accompanied by a LAN party hackathon, which is after the event itself, which is held in‬‬

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:25,680
‫‫the room over there, at 4:30 sharp, and its executive judge and leader is Farooq‬‬

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,720
‫‫Karimizadeh, whom you see there. Do you want to stand up for a minute so the kids can see you? Many people‬‬

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,960
‫‫were waiting for you. Yes, members who are in the PC Warm-up, that's Farooq. Yes.‬‬

00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:45,039
‫‫Then the hackathon will also be held there at 4:30, but when the hackathon is held in that room,‬‬

9
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,719
‫‫here we also have open networking discussion for the kids who don't want to participate in the hackathon.‬‬

‫‫hackathon. Let me explain something to you, we wanted to hold this event in a very‬‬

12
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:11,000
‫‫simple way. What was common and in other countries, free software events were held in this way. Events in Iran have become a bit too luxurious. We tried‬‬

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
‫‫to do it this way. For example, we could have held classes, or even taken the whole‬‬

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,280
‫‫lower hall and filled it with 600 people, but the output was more valuable to us, and‬‬

‫‫here you see we have no pixels, no stickers, no lanyards; things that‬‬

‫‫Tehran.log does, we don't imitate them. Who here are from Tehran?‬‬

17

19
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,920
‫‫Well, you are definitely from Fasa. Is Farooq from Bandar? Is Delta also from Bandar?‬‬

20
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:52,640
‫‫And you? Didn't you come from Dezful yourself? Why are you holding your hand down? Are you from Shiraz too?‬‬

21
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,960
‫‫Also from Shiraz. Okay. Uh, I mentioned to you that the introduction is with a video that‬‬

22
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:06,240

23
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:13,360
‫‫held. Before all this, we have an introduction. In the introduction, given the number of people we are, a last name, the field you are working in, if you have a free project,‬‬

24
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,800
‫‫well, introduce it. Say, for example, I released this project, it solves this need, or‬‬

‫‫so the kids get to know you and you introduce yourself to the kids.‬‬

28

‫‫Tell us about the video. Hello everyone. I'm Delta. Okay, no, what are you doing?‬‬

29
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,360
‫‫I'm not doing anything special. Okay kids, this is Delta.‬‬

31

‫‫Are you? Oh, you will come up and explain? You don't have to stand up if you're not comfortable.‬‬

32
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,120
‫‫I'm Elnaz, a C++ programmer. And you don't have a free project? You should make a PR on GitHub tonight.‬‬

‫‫Well, besides Widgetify, you wrote something else too. There's a dnsChanger. Yes, that's it.‬‬

38
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,120
‫‫His free project even had 77,000 users. He says he didn't do anything!‬‬

41
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:02,959
‫‫Yes, that's you. This side, I work on Android. You had two free projects?‬‬

42
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,400
‫‫You should have said. Oh, it's finished? Will you put your free project in the group?‬‬

43
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:16,720
‫‫It's not free? And that's okay too. Kids will come and contribute. Mohammad, are you here?‬‬

60

‫‫Make one tonight. Hello, I'm Arash Andishgar, interested in free software.‬‬

78
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,120
‫‫Hello, I'm Goudarz Jafari, a little bit of a programmer and I contribute a little bit. A little bit?‬‬

79
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:46,200
‫‫And the "little bit" he talks about, if you check his stats, it's a lot. Hello, I'm Shahriar, IT technician, a little bit interested in Linux, from that large community,‬‬

80
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,800
‫‫and a fierce enemy of showmen. Yes, greetings to you. Showmen. He fights showmen.‬‬

85
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,079
‫‫Okay, thanks everyone. We have a video, this video is produced by FSF, and on our kids' side, it has been‬‬

86
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:32,959
‫‫dubbed. Let me bring this over here.‬‬

87
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,880
‫‫Kids, right here, I'll curse Mac for a bit, it's really a crappy system. I'm forced to‬‬

88
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,800
‫‫use it out of necessity.‬‬

89
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:52,680
‫‫And it's okay, for promoting free software, sometimes our operating system is like this. If the Tehran.log kids were here,‬‬

90
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,760
‫‫they would attack, but they can't attack us. Oh,‬‬

91

‫‫Where did it go?‬‬

92
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,880
‫‫The decisions we make about the technology we use in our daily lives shape the world. For example, consider electric cars or the apps on your phone,‬‬

93
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,000
‫‫your personal computer, or on the internet, the software you use for work or study. The creators of these programs build a compelling way to experience the world,‬‬

94
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,880
‫‫but don't make this mistake, they don't serve you. Ultimately, our work is about‬‬

‫Software arrives that often deprives us of important rights and freedoms, in other words,‬

103
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,079
‫with non-free software, we walk in the dark. We cannot understand popular software‬

104
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:33,720
‫today because most of them are proprietary, which means our active participation‬

105
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:39,160
‫is deliberately limited. Instead, ultimately, the software controls us. This‬

106
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,480
‫is a story about how the world is and how it could be, when we don't examine‬

107
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,519
‫what happens? What happens when we follow the trail of breadcrumbs with the promise of convenience?‬

108
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,600
‫Given the presence of software in your life, shouldn't you be able to look inside‬

109
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,279
‫the software to see how it works? Shouldn't you be able to use‬

110
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,920
‫them however you want, make any changes you want, and share them‬

111
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,320
‫within your community? To live in a world where we control‬

112
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:15,260
‫our technologies, we need software that is free.‬

113
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:20,639
‫[Applause] Every software is essentially a set of‬

114
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,120
‫instructions to the computer that assemble like bricks to build your software.‬

115
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:32,040
‫There is a global community of people who believe software should‬

116
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:39,519
‫serve you, the user. You should be able to freely access these building blocks,‬

117
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,320
‫make changes, and share them however you want, and when‬

118
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,519
‫you can do these things, we call that free software. With free software,‬

119
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,279
‫not only can you check that the software does what it says,‬

120
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:59,920
‫like protecting your privacy, you can change it to do new work,‬

121
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,399
‫something creative. You can solve any problem you can imagine.‬

122
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:10,839
‫We protect this freedom using a concept called copyleft. This‬

123
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:17,199
‫ensures that all modified and extended versions of the software are also required to be‬

124
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:23,720
‫free. Software freedom is worth fighting for. As a user, you have the power‬

125
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:30,079
‫to demand change. You can make conscious decisions towards freedom.‬

126
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:35,639
‫Gradually and step by step. There are free programs you can start using from‬

127
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:42,120
‫today, which provide ethical alternatives to the software on your computer and mobile phone.‬

128
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,839
‫Over time, you can replace more and more parts of‬

129
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,320
‫your digital life. Pay attention now. A shocking new video‬

130
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,120
‫from a school teacher, who wandered into a bar and realized what's really going on inside the devices we carry in‬

131
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,079
‫our pockets. It turned out they are a kind of mind control and‬

132
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,160
‫that ultimately, you suddenly walk straight into the mouth of monsters. Software freedom‬

133
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,240
‫is important. Not just when we think about technology, but for a free society.‬

134
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,040
‫So from now on, when you talk about any kind of freedom, please‬

135
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:21,120
‫consider the role that software also plays in it. The Free Software Foundation‬

136
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:27,360
‫has fought for software freedom since 1985. The journey‬

137
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:34,920
‫will not end until we all climb the ladder of freedom.‬

138
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:40,680
‫[Music] Okay guys, that was the video "Escape to Freedom"‬

139
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:46,000
‫which was sent to us by the FSF, where we had a story that likened the promises of‬
