‫[Music]
Hi everyone, I hope you're doing well.‬

4
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:17,920
‫I'm very happy to have come to Shiraz and be here with
you. My name is Ali Ja'farabadi, the tagline that‬

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:26,240
‫I'm known by is "Tech Lead" and smartification consultant.
More than being active in the private sector,‬

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:33,840
‫I have worked in government sectors, and we also have a small startup ourselves.‬

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,800
‫Which I won't name so it's not an advertisement. I was the project
manager for the smartification of the Heart Center‬

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:49,559
‫in Tehran, as well as the Stock Exchange
Organization. I'm here today to talk a little bit about‬

9
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:56,600
‫freedom in design. I feel that there's truly a lack of it.‬

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,760
‫When the kids were introducing themselves, the number of front-end workers, application‬

11
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,640
‫developers was significant. My request is that
back-end developers also pay attention to this issue.‬

12
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,400
‫You can find me online through these two links and I think‬

13
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,159
‫I am only active on these two social networks.‬

14
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:26,040
‫I am. This whole presentation is a brief one, I won't take up too much of your time. The whole presentation is about one‬

15
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,040
‫question. Which is limitation or‬

16
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:41,119
‫creativity? Let two or three people answer randomly. Who wants to answer?‬

17
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:50,280
‫What was the question? Limitation or creativity? It's very simple, in my opinion, it depends.‬

18
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:58,000
‫Explanations. Some people like limitation. For example, for initial users, it's okay, it's an operating system.‬

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,479
‫It has some software, they can't apply all of it in its system... let me talk. Some people in this group probably‬

20
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:11,520
‫prefer creativity. Well, you see, the concept‬

21
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,400
‫is usually in contrast with‬

22
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:23,280
‫each other. Well, in the world of [art?], especially now in the world of [unclear], we have no limitations. You can use‬

23
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,959
‫any material you want, bring anything you want, but‬

24
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,400
‫for example, the world of IT and all that, we have some limitations anyway, now because of‬

25
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:43,400
‫hardware, the technology we work with, there are limitations, but well, it can be much less, and‬

26
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:50,040
‫other friends, your opinion is very...‬

27
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,519
‫It can't have a pure definition, why,
especially in‬

28
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,760
‫design, what we now call
user experience, is something‬

29
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,760
‫that is defined by large companies, and
if, for example, it's not within that range, that‬

30
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:16,120
‫creativity that someone uses is not within that range,
it won't be welcomed, and the user‬

31
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:25,959
‫user doesn't know what to do with the software, for example.
Thanks, and in my opinion, it can be like a man, like‬

32
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,720
‫like physics which came into being because of this, because‬

33
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:38,760
‫it was created because
America imposed restrictions on China in‬

34
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:47,200
‫the export of chips and access to information
for making such chips which are used for artificial intelligence‬

35
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,200
‫are useful, and this caused the Chinese‬

36
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:59,319
‫to start building AI that costs
much, much less than American AI,‬

37
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:05,040
‫and this caused them to show much
more creativity in this process.‬

38
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:13,239
‫Thank you. The sum of the points we
heard is valuable and correct, but‬

39
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:21,720
‫the most important thing is that we are free,
we choose ourselves, whether to be limited or creative.‬

40
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,919
‫In my opinion, the limitation you brought up regarding this creativity is mostly a cliché concept. This limitation that‬

41
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,280
‫you set is higher than many people's ceiling. For example, as friends said, if someone thinks that‬

42
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,199
‫a software, a platform has really limited
them and they really have the power, they themselves‬

43
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,880
‫can go for creativity. It's not necessary
for the policy to determine whether you become limited or not.‬

44
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,680
‫But in my opinion, the thing is that
the majority of this limitation, which has a negative vibe,‬

45
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,960
‫is higher than the ceiling of many users of that platform and that
collection. There is no need at all for‬

46
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:04,160
‫it to become creativity in the first layer. My opinion
is that regardless of the concept of limitation and creativity,‬

47
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,320
‫which everyone can have a different definition of,
we should pay attention to the fact that the user is free‬

48
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:17,080
‫to choose for themselves whether to be limited or creative.
We might be able to line up a few more words here,‬

49
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:24,400
‫but the user's freedom in choosing
limitation or creativity is in their own hands. So we, as‬

50
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,680
‫the user community that defines
ourselves, are free, and our slogan is that one of‬

51
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:39,360
‫our achievements is creativity. We must have this respect
for the freedom of users who like‬

52
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,199
‫are using macOS, who like to use non-free tools. This‬

53
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:52,919
‫is their choice, so what is our mission? To make people understand...‬

54
00:05:52,919 --> 00:06:00,400
‫that free products are the best products. With free products, we can achieve our goals easier, better, and with higher quality...‬

55
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,599
‫We can reach our goals more. Let's keep this question in mind, the discussion...‬

56
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:12,120
‫of the whole presentation is about this question. Let's remember...‬

57
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:18,599
‫Saber. I think you should give him a round of applause.‬

58
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:24,680
‫[Applause] I... I know Shiraz by the name Saber.‬

59
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:31,240
‫And maybe many... by Karim Khan Citadel and Vakil Bazaar and these...‬

60
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:37,800
‫things, but I know Shiraz, Fasa, and this entire region by the name Saber.‬

61
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,759
‫Before the presentation, we were talking with Abbas, with Mr. Davarpanah. We were saying it doesn't matter if we...‬

62
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,680
‫always and everywhere keep raising and glorifying Saber's memory. What matters is how many...‬

63
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,560
‫Forks are taken from the Minister font. Now that Saber is gone, is the path he started...‬

64
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:05,160
‫in the field of font design, this is Saber's own words. He said I made what I needed...‬

65
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:11,400
‫myself and then shared it. How much is this continuing? Thank you for your kindness and...‬

66
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:19,919
‫grace. I hope Saber's soul is also happy and a large number of users are using it...‬

67
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:25,360
‫are doing. I also included this so there's one more slide and...‬

68
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:33,840
‫it's not unaffected by today's events. I personally have a special passion for this region and...‬

69
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:40,560
‫felt that since the videos are also going to be published by FSF, it's not bad to include this. We have a...‬

70
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,160
‫gulf, and that is the Persian Gulf.‬

71
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:52,759
‫I think these two windows are familiar to you. Which one do you like more? Those who...‬

72
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:58,000
‫like Microsoft Word more, can they raise their hands? In UI/UX, I'm...‬

73
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:06,479
‫just talking about UI/UX, not functionality. Thanks, feel free. I'm the first myself.‬

74
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:12,080
‫Okay, those who like LibreOffice, raise your hands. Thanks, thanks. The rest don't like it at all...‬

75
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,319
‫don't? What was that like? Yes, it became somewhat similar...‬

76
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:24,039
‫it did. I want to get to something later. The rest, meaning they don't use either of these products at all...‬

77
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:28,199
‫‫don't? For example, do you use WPS or other things?‬‬

78
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,560
‫‫With Notepad and Notepad++, VS Code, and...‬‬

79
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:42,479
‫‫This is one of the weaknesses that free products have: the issue of design and functionality. Libre...‬‬

80
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,480
‫‫offers much, much better functionality. The protocols we have in Libre are truly...‬‬

81
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,040
‫‫Excellent, truly excellent. But I, whose system is dual-boot, whenever I have office work, I go into...‬‬

82
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,519
‫‫Windows, and the rest of my work is here. Now imagine with what difficulty I...‬‬

83
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:07,519
‫‫do documentation work. Because of what? Because this UI seems to be stuck in the same...‬‬

84
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,399
‫‫year 2003, stuck in the same year 2010...‬‬

85
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,839
‫‫It is. Then the question arises: why should we come and improve its UI?‬‬

86
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:30,000
‫‫Where's the money? Because it's very technical... Yes, yes, yes, it's not for that. I'm comfortable with the technical part...‬‬

87
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,839
‫‫Be. Yes, but the technical GUI must be strong, the UX must be strong. This way...‬‬

88
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,760
‫‫The person is not comfortable. Do you know why no company goes towards...‬‬

89
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:47,160
‫‫Improving it? I'm talking about Libre. We have free products... not free, we have products that, for example...‬‬

90
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,600
‫‫Ubuntu comes up and has a very good UX and UI...‬‬

91
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,959
‫‫It has. Don't you know? Look, one issue is the general perception that anything free is gratis.‬‬

92
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:04,839
‫‫This is wrong. Not everything free is gratis. We can put a condition in our license, say...‬‬

93
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:10,240
‫‫It should be copyleft, for example, just as we can put this condition, we can also put other conditions...‬‬

94
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:17,440
‫‫So let's have this rule: freedom is different from price and being free of charge.‬‬

95
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,200
‫‫In...‬‬

96
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:27,600
‫‫If we want to discuss freedom in design, we have four laws of freedom that apply to...‬‬

97
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:37,480
‫‫Software is talked about. In design, the space is a bit different. We say what design is...‬‬

98
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,200
‫‫Free? Any ideas?‬‬

99
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,920
‫‫Can we use free tools for design and say our design is...‬‬

100
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,279
‫‫Free design. For example, from Inkscape, for example, from GIMP and...‬‬

101
00:10:54,279 --> 00:11:01,360
‫‫And you can freely publish the design we create. These two are...‬‬

102
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,839
‫They differ from each other. I think ultimate freedom is when we use tools...‬

103
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:12,519
‫free tools for free productions. What kind of freedom? Anything we can see,‬

104
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:17,760
‫read it, understand it, change it, and...‬

105
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,160
‫share what we need and make it available for others to use.‬

106
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,639
‫use it ourselves and others can use it too. But why did we come and...‬

107
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:36,120
‫are talking about freedom in design? I am a programmer...‬

108
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:46,240
‫I've been a programmer for almost ten years: QC++, JS, and...‬

109
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:53,639
‫and we presented this topic at Tehran Lug, a bit more detailed. Considering the design...‬

110
00:11:53,639 --> 00:12:01,680
‫system, I just came here to Shiraz, and I go to other places too, to say that we should be surprised‬

111
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:08,880
‫by the topic of des... what the user brings to us, the topic of design...‬

112
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:16,720
‫let's not just see freedom in coding our products. Let's not just see freedom in publishing...‬

113
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,320
‫our documents, putting types. A musician can produce a free song with a free license‬

114
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:30,040
‫to be used. A designer can create a design system and...‬

115
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:36,120
‫be used. I strongly, strongly, strongly emphasize that we should strive‬

116
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:45,680
‫to use free tools, and the last topic from this set‬

117
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:53,040
‫of slides I want to talk to you about is the topic of designing systems in a project. Usually, there is a manager,‬

118
00:12:53,040 --> 00:13:01,440
‫a development team, and a design team. There is a big gap between these three teams‬

119
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:08,480
‫which are usually the common arguments between designers, front-end developers, front-end developers, back-end developers in...‬

120
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,839
‫it's more common. If we have a good design system‬

121
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,040
‫have,‬

122
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:23,839
‫many problems won't arise, and we can have good software... But when‬

123
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,320
‫we are talking about a community, that community must have its own design system‬

124
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,600
‫have. Just as you see when you install Gnome, whether on mobile, on a watch,‬

125
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,360
‫or on a computer, it is consistent with a design‬

126
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,160
‫system and arranges the page for you, shows it.‬

127
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:50,320
‫and provide the designs to you. We are currently lacking something, I'm not saying we don't have it...‬

128
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,079
‫We have a design system standard that has worked very well. You can see the...‬

129
00:13:55,079 --> 00:14:03,199
‫systems that exist, right-to-left and left-to-right. What I think is missing and needs to be...‬

130
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,480
‫addressed is font design, and a design system...‬

131
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:13,959
‫for designing applications. Free applications, if we have our own or contribute...‬

132
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:19,160
‫to free applications that exist in the world, on the design...‬

133
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:25,120
‫systems that are being used in the world...‬

134
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,480
‫And here is a... standard that...‬

135
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:38,440
‫...is a very, very, very important topic.‬

136
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:45,639
‫And I think we had one designer in the group, right? Who was it? Was it you? What...‬

137
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:52,199
‫tools do you use? In Figma. You know there are other free tools that...‬

138
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:58,160
‫you can use, but you use Figma? Can I ask why? Because...‬

139
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:04,519
‫it's more in demand in the job market... Figma. Frontend developers can say on what platform...‬

140
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:12,480
‫they get their work analyzed. If anyone uses something other than Figma...‬

141
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,759
‫Why is Figma famous? I...‬

142
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:22,959
‫More famous, why? A large community... its community is large. The community it has now is...‬

143
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:29,279
‫any file you want, or even an icon or any page you want, you are connected. We used to have other...‬

144
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,120
‫applications before, like Adobe XD, why didn't they...‬

145
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:41,920
‫gain traction? I think... Yes, yes, I know, I know. I want to know even...‬

146
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,079
‫among paid ones, why is Figma rising? Why did Adobe...‬

147
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:54,519
‫...Well, personally, the experience I had was years ago... I don't know how many years ago, 20... when I was very interested...‬

148
00:15:54,519 --> 00:16:01,480
‫in using open-source software and instead of using that, and I was new to the world of frontend and...‬

149
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,279
‫I searched a lot for this, I searched a lot, the only...‬

150
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:12,360
‫alternative was a home one that really had no... it didn't have any proper features at that time...‬

151
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:19,800
‫It hasn't changed now, it didn't have it. I can say because most of my work is...‬

152
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:28,160
‫It has become common for everyone to use the same thing. The point is that...‬

153
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:34,319
‫Adobe XD was there before and offered good features. Movies really, finally from a point...‬

154
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:39,680
‫started, and I think the simplicity...‬

155
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,000
‫of design that Figma had and anyone could work with...‬

156
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:52,279
‫The simplicity of design that Figma had and anyone could work with it, is one of the...‬

157
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:58,800
‫KPIs we can discuss and it was definitely the reason for Figma's growth. Something...‬

158
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:06,360
‫that Adobe XD didn't have. Being web-based is one of its important features, which again affects its design...‬

159
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:11,520
‫affects, the point is that...‬

160
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:21,000
‫If we are really talking about free industry, free software, free hardware,‬

161
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,720
‫free design, we must shift our role as well.‬

162
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:34,200
‫Our frontend developers should work on UIs, we should have a design system. If someone...‬

163
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:40,799
‫designs, our design system, good internal right-to-left, for example, the two or three that exist, now...‬

164
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:47,880
‫we don't have alternatives and so on anymore. After a while, when their customers increase...‬

165
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:54,320
‫they become a standard in a way, they become dictated in a way.‬

166
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:01,440
‫Commercial goals come behind it. This market diversity can help us a lot and a file...‬

167
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,960
‫I had another presentation file that I didn't want to take too much of your time. That's why now it's up to...‬

168
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,760
‫Davarpanah. I will suffice with this.‬

169
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:22,640
‫that you take this matter seriously, that we enter the discussion of design and also have contribution towards design...‬

170
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,080
‫and I think we should appreciate people like Mr. Davarpanah. Of course, this is part...‬

171
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:35,120
‫of the presentation. I went to Bandar, Mr. Davarpanah was there, I came to Shiraz, Mr. Davarpanah is here, Isfahan...‬

172
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:41,600
‫Mr. Davarpanah was there, and he is everywhere I go. You definitely know that these events are not events...‬

173
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,520
‫that just end, and this contribution that he is making for the community...‬

174
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:51,600
‫building in the country is a very, very, very valuable...‬

175
00:18:51,600 --> 00:19:00,440
‫activity. I am at your service if there is any question or point to answer...‬

176
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:07,280
‫Let me say something first, firstly I didn't think it would be an attractive presentation, and secondly, no, the difference...‬

177
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,120
‫...does. What I want to say about free software,
what we have a lot of...‬

178
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,840
‫What we lack in this program is
a real artist.‬

179
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:29,240
‫[Music]
We have very few. I also have this feeling that we need to shake up this...‬

180
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,360
‫...system.‬

181
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,360
‫Char Sand.‬

182
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:49,360
‫What's happened now is that programmers...
For example, you go to the log, you go to Shiraz Linux, you come...‬

183
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:55,039
‫...it seems like only programmers are there. It seems like we don't need artists.
In this community, it seems like, for example, designers...‬

184
00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:00,000
‫...we don't need in this community. Then, for example, designers left, designers...‬

185
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,440
‫...have other communities. Look, if our goal is freedom, we shouldn't just look at the code...‬

186
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,679
‫...see.‬

187
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,960
‫No, no, this is what you are saying, I am...‬

188
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:26,000
‫Yeah, I think it has become very cliché.
I got up from Tehran and came here to...‬

189
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,280
‫...say this. I feel a bit like minds are
stuck in a framework. Everyone thinks they have to be...‬

190
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,400
‫...programmers to be in this... It's like someone
who is a writer cannot be a UX...‬

191
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:43,480
‫...writer or a translator for, say, a free operating
system. Well, we should bring these people in. We...‬

192
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:50,400
‫...programmers are saturated now. We should
bring... Go ahead. I have this artist who...‬

193
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,760
‫...engage with the community of artists. No artist is willing
to...‬

194
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:04,760
‫...make their work freely available.
None of them like the creative work they have done...‬

195
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:12,640
‫...and put a lot of effort into... Now this
programmer's thinking... is very...‬

196
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:20,200
‫...less, but among those artists, it's a lot. How do you define
art? A creative work...‬

197
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,880
‫Your good name? I don't...
Ms. Ren.‬

198
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,880
‫Ren. A creative work is not necessarily art...‬

199
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,880
‫I don't know. I neither confirm nor...
No, well, what I mean is, for example, a...‬

200
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:43,520
‫...doesn't come and give their work for free. Someone who,
for example, not for free, but freely makes it available to someone...‬

201
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:51,919
‫...so they can use their idea. Or this
sculptor... that's not the case. A writer...‬

202
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,080
‫‫I agree, I agree in...‬‬

203
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:03,360
‫‫That's exactly the issue, why is this
mindset not common among artists but more so among programmers?‬‬

204
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,799
‫‫More common?‬‬

205
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,320
‫‫Yes.
Dear Ronak, let me get to a point‬‬

206
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:19,400
‫‫I'm saying, programmers know the difference between class and
instance very well, the difference between class and object very well.‬‬

207
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:26,159
‫‫We consider art the plan of what has been created.‬‬

208
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,480
‫‫Let me put it simpler.
Is the recipe for Ghormeh Sabzi the art of Ghormeh Sabzi or the‬‬

209
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,799
‫‫Ghormeh Sabzi that has been cooked? Both. I hope this is well...‬‬

210
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:44,279
‫‫Correct... Both. Both. Which one can
be free? The recipe, I said, well, everyone knows it.‬‬

211
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:51,480
‫‫Well, the one who executes it is truly now the owner... someone, which one would you like others
to be free?‬‬

212
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,520
‫‫The blueprint or the sculpture? Can the sculpture even be free?‬‬

213
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:03,320
‫‫No, not really. No one is usually willing to own that... the work usually.‬‬

214
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:10,960
‫‫It's very common among artists, and what does he do with it? He likes to, let's say, make it‬‬

215
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,960
‫‫worthless? He holds exhibitions and earns income from it,
and he is free to do this or not.‬‬

216
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:23,360
‫‫He is definitely free to make his art available freely, for example, so that anyone who wants can use it.‬‬

217
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,400
‫‫To share the idea that was in his mind and say, for example, this is not mine, I took it from somewhere else.‬‬

218
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:35,320
‫‫You can... Sorry, one thing is that if you speak louder and pause between sentences, it will be much better.‬‬

219
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:44,159
‫‫I have a question. Do you think artists, if they had a source of income for their free work, couldn't do this?‬‬

220
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:52,279
‫‫Well, see, I've always said this.‬‬

221
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:57,760
‫‫I said that from... a lot of opportunities... which, well, within art despite its existence... I always say it too, because an artist‬‬

222
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:06,559
‫‫needs money. Needs money to buy canvases, to employ people, to buy their work tools.‬‬

223
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:12,480
‫‫And if this currency is easily available from this source of income, well, why not? Many of the concerns‬‬

224
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:19,080
‫‫of many artists are precisely the lack of financial resources. That's it. Now, my first point was that being free is different from being free of charge.‬‬

225
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:26,240
‫‫I am now less...‬‬

226
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,200
‫‫‬‬

227
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:38,440
‫‫Until a few months ago, I was developing free software
and getting paid for it.‬‬

228
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:44,880
‫‫Yeah, sorry, I misused some terms, I realized it myself. Instead of...‬‬

229
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:52,960
‫‫...each other, but my point is that the idea, now, the idea of the work that is done...‬‬

230
00:24:52,960 --> 00:25:01,799
‫‫...is often exclusive to the artist. Yes, for example, it could be the formulation of a material...‬‬

231
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:08,000
‫‫...that they used to create a design, calculations of the angles that they used exactly for this...‬‬

232
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:16,240
‫‫...sculpture. And this is a very important point that I hope we will get to by the end of today's presentation.‬‬

233
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:24,440
‫‫It's that as someone with a hammer, I see all challenges as nails, and I want to solve this...‬‬

234
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:30,640
‫‫...challenge with it. As someone whose work is data, everything they tell me, I either take it towards ASP or...‬‬

235
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:38,559
‫‫...Laser or WPF or something like that. Well, this point is very important, that if we are talking...‬‬

236
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:44,039
‫‫...about design, we ARE talking about design! I, who was a backend developer...‬‬

237
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:49,240
‫‫...then became a frontend developer, then became a system engineer.‬‬

238
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:55,840
‫‫Now I saw design as something different in each phase. Somewhere I saw database design, somewhere...‬‬

239
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:02,520
‫‫...I saw API design, somewhere I saw system design, for example. Well, or...‬‬

240
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:10,679
‫‫...someone who is a frontend worker, maybe designing a, I don't know, a landing page. Someone who works with hard...‬‬

241
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:16,120
‫‫...ware, designing a PCB. I want to...‬‬

242
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:23,279
‫‫...get out of this space. If we are talking about freedom, if we want...‬‬

243
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,960
‫‫...free software to increase, the culture of freedom to spread...‬‬

244
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:34,559
‫‫...please, let's have freedom in all aspects, in all aspects of...‬‬

245
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:42,480
‫‫...life. If we are talking about design, if we are talking about implementation, if we are talking about testing and...‬‬

246
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:49,120
‫‫...something else that we lack a lot in the discussion of free culture, which is a subset of free software...‬‬

247
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:57,120
‫‫...is the discussion of economy, how a free software can... Yes, I, in...‬‬

248
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:05,880
‫‫...'96 SFD, in '95 Jadi had a presentation titled "Free Economy"...‬‬

249
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:12,720
‫‫...Jadi also has another presentation called "Society", I think it was SFD '94. Those...‬‬

250
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,360
‫‫...years I was mostly giving programming presentations, it was Q and such...‬‬

251
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:23,440
‫‫...things. I recommend you watch this. Mobin Shatarian also has a presentation again at SFD '95...‬‬

252
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:30,039
‫...under the name of low-ranking employee. He asks what a low-ranking employee is? Someone who joins an organization...‬

253
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:36,360
‫is very motivated, works very hard, and the organization constantly gives them responsibility.‬

254
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:42,720
‫It reaches a point where they are unfair to themselves and to the organization. And Mobin continues...‬

255
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,320
‫to talk about how software freedom, the existence of something like WordPress, helps...‬

256
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,679
‫us not to have alienated employees, and how this...‬

257
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:58,880
‫culture can be eradicated.
There was a question at the end of this presentation that I wanted...‬

258
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,640
‫to ask you: How do you translate quality in a product?‬

259
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:10,360
‫What is quality? When do we say this is a product with...‬

260
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:19,919
‫award-winning quality? Its products lead to customer satisfaction... ultimately customer satisfaction?‬

261
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:30,120
‫Yes. And that it can be used in the long run and always works correctly... well...‬

262
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:38,320
‫its performance in different areas for people... what should it be? For example, you're now mentioning different areas...‬

263
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:44,200
‫You're giving examples. For a software to come out that is useful for all people who are active in different areas...‬

264
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:51,440
‫different areas here.‬

265
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:58,919
‫I think quality is multi-dimensional. A software that... why do we say this is the best...‬

266
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:07,600
‫software? Meaning it has the best... its speed is good, it uses color psychology correctly...‬

267
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:14,399
‫and... these things. But what is ultimately important in everything?‬

268
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,760
‫What is important?‬

269
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:26,279
‫The quality of a product must solve the problem it targets in the best possible way. And that is its quality.‬

270
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:33,279
‫You put it very attractively. Right here... its best possible way, what's its KPI? By what ruler do we measure the best possible...‬

271
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:42,240
‫possible way? User experience. Thanks. Everything and everything and everything in design is related to...‬

272
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,559
‫experience engineering. Experience Engineer. We have CX, we have UX...‬

273
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:56,559
‫We have BX, I don't know, we have DX. Ultimately, it's the experience that the user is...‬

274
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:02,600
‫the user is aiming for. This point is very... As a developer, I'm more comfortable with CI/N...‬

275
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:11,480
‫I'm more comfortable. Someone else isn't, CI is easier. We also saw a picture of him here, let's remember...‬

276
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:18,919
‫let's remember him. In the discussion of design systems, these four qualities are very important: focus and problem-solving, certainty...‬

277
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:24,399
‫have. We didn't see anything strange from you once.
It should have good speed.‬

278
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:32,519
‫Speed doesn't get stuck again, speed
in development, implementation,
and testing, everything should be integrated.‬

279
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:40,080
‫Okay, what does integrated mean?
Look, if I built a prototype and used a...‬

280
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:46,480
‫design system and later decided
to change a part of it, well...‬

281
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:52,039
‫all the elements that followed that pattern
must change, it should be integrated.‬

282
